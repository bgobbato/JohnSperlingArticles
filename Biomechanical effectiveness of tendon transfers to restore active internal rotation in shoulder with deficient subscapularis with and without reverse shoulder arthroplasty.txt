The4 purpose of this study was to determine and compare the internal rotation moment5 arm(IRMA)of the sternal head of the pectoralis major(PM),latissimus dorsi(LD) and teres6 major(TM)when transferred to different insertion sites to restore shoulder internal rotation7 with and without reverse shoulder arthroplasty(RSA).8 Methods:Six fresh-frozen right hemithoraces were prepared and evaluated using a custom9 tendon transfer model to determine IRMA of different tend  n t ansfers using the tendon and10 joint displacement method. Five tendon-transfer pairs we e modeled using a single suture and11 tested before and after implantation of a RSA(Compr h nsive, Biomet, Warsaw IN,12 USA):PM to the insertion site of the subscapula is(SSC),LD to the anterior insertion site of13 the supraspinatus tendon on the greater tuberosity(SSP),LD to SSC,TM to SSP and TM to14	SSC. The subscapularis was	ot rep ired	t the end of the RSA procedure to simulate a15 subscapularis deficiency. The PM transfer was passed under the conjoined tendon when tested16 on the intact shoulder and above the conjoined tendon when tested with a RSA.17 Results:Tendon transfers were shown to have a significant effect on IRMA. The effect of18 transferred tendons was significantly affected by the position of the humerus. With the19 humerus adducted the IRMA of the TM-SSP(14.1mm±3.1mm)was significantly greater than20 the other transfers. With the humerus abducted to 90° the IRMAs of the LD-21 SSP(30.0mm±5.4mm) and TM-SSP(28.4mm±6.6mm)were sign ificantly greater than the22 IRMA of other transfer options.  The IRMA of the native shoulder differed significantly from23 that of the RSA state for all tendon transfers. With the humerus adducted to the side of the24 body the IRMA of the RSA PM-SSC transfer was significantly greater than without an
25 RSA(19. mm±6.4mm vs 7.1mm±0.9mm),demonstrating incr eased efficiency for internal26 rotation in the RSA state.27 Conclusion:Tendon transfers to restore shoulder internal rotation differ in effectiveness and28 may be affected by arm position and by implantation of a lateralized humerus/lateralized29 glenoid RSA. LD potentially results in superior restoration of shoulder internal rotation in a30 native shoulder (given the risk of nerve compression with the TM transfer)compared to PM31 and should be considered as a potential tendon transfer to restore internal rotation in selected32 patients. In combination with a lateralized humerus/lateralized glen  id RSA, the fulcrum33 provided by the biomechanics of the semi-constrained implant all  ws the PM transfer to34 become a more efficient tendon transfer to restore active inte nal rotation.35 Level of Evidence: Basic Science Study; Biom chanics36 Keywords: reverse shoulder arthroplasty; tendon t ansfer; irreparable rotator cuff tear;37 subscapularis tear; internal rotation;  atissimus dorsi; pectoralis; teres major383940 Loss of active shoulder internal rotation can be very disabling. The most common cause of41 loss of internal rotation is irreparable tearing of the subscapularis tendon. Patients usually42 experience pain and may exhibit anterior apprehension, subluxation/instability and43 pseudoparalysis 6, 13.44 Loss of active shoulder internal rotation can also be seen in patients who undergo reverse45 shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). In this setting though patients experience significant46 improvement of shoulder motion, gains in shoulder internal rotation can be very47 unpredictable1, 15, 23. It has been shown that repair of the subscapularis may improve48 postoperative internal rotation, especially if the repair is proven to be healed5; however,49 outcomes are not consistent10,11,16.
50 Several tendon transfers have been described for the management of an irreparable51 subscapularis tear. The most common transfers reported are the pectoralis minor4,20or the52 pectoralis major26. Several studies have shown satisfactory long-term results after transfer of53 the sternal head of the pectoralis major tendon.9, 17, 19, 22  However, other reports have shown54 poor outcomes of this transfer, especially in patients with concurrent anterior instability8, 19.55 Poor outcomes with the pectoralis major transfer may be due to the fact that the line of pull of56 the pectoralis major does not replicate that of the subscapularis. An ideal tendon transfer57 should adhere to five basic biomechanical principles: theprooftransferredmuscle must have a58 similar (i) line of pull, (ii) tension and (iii) excursion to that  f the muscle replaced; (iv) one59 transfer should be used to replace only one deficient function; (v) the donor muscle must have60 normal strength. When evaluating the location and line    pull of the pectoralis major61 compared to the subscapularis, the sternal head of the pectoralis major originates from the62 anterior chest wall, whereas the subscapu aris originates from the anterior scapular body,63	which is positioned on the posterior	spect of the chest wall (Fig. 1). In 2014, Elhassan et al64 described the feasibility of t ansfe ring muscle posterior to the chest wall (teres major or65 latissimus dorsi) anteri  rly to replicate the line of pull of the subscapularis muscle7. To our66 knowledge, no study has evaluated the outcome of tendon transfers to restore internal rotation67 after RSA. Also, though an anatomic study has been done to prove the feasibility of transfer68 of the latissimus and/or teres major to reconstruct an irreparable subscapularis, no prior69 biomechanical study has evaluated the effectiveness of these transfers or the pectoralis70 transfer to restore shoulder internal rotation to the native shoulder with a deficient anterior71 rotator cuff tear or in shoulder with RSA.72 The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the internal rotation moment arm73 (IRMA) of different types of tendon transfers to restore shoulder internal rotation with and74 without RSA.
7576 Methods77 Cadaveric shoulder model78 Six fresh frozen right hemithorax/shoulder girdle cadaveric specimens (4 men, 2 women)79 were used for this study. The mean age of the specimens at the time of death was 86 years old80 (± 7.71). Fluoroscopic imaging was used to assess each shoulder to rule out radiographic81 signs of glenohumeral arthritis. Following dissection, the articular surfaces, capsular tissues,82 and rotator cuff musculature were examined.  Gross evidenceprooffullthickness cartilage loss,83 visible rotator cuff tears or evidence of prior surgery mate ial  esulted in elimination of the84 specimen.85 Cadaveric specimens were prepared following the protocol previously described by Hartzler86 et al.12 The upper extremities were prepared by cutting the arm at the mid-humerus below the87 deltoid insertion. A fiberglass intramedu  ary rod was placed into the remaining humeral shaft88 and secured with cross pins. Cad veric he ds were removed at a level to preserve the cervical89	vertebrae and the origin of the	pper trapezius muscle.  Solid organs were removed from the90 chest and abdominal cavities. Musculature originating or inserting from the spine, pelvis,91 sternum, ribcage, thorax, back, and shoulder girdle were otherwise preserved.92 Skin and subcutaneous tissues were removed to allow direct visualization of the underlying93 shoulder and periscapular musculature. Each specimen was secured to the custom positioner94 used in our previous publication12. The specimens native lordotic and kyphotic curvatures95 were preserved during fixation of the spinal column to the custom positioner.96 The Polhemus Fastrak (Colchester, VT, USA) 3-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic tracking97 system was used to capture raw kinematic data. This system utilizes sensors which can be98 fixed to a cadaveric specimen.  These sensors are tracked by a small electromagnetic field for99 changes in position and orientation with 6° of free dom. Sensors were fixed to the scapula,
100 humerus, and thorax.  A coordinate system was then established according to International101 Society of Biomechanics according to the recommendations for each bone. Euler angles were102 measured to determine glenohumeral joint angles. The humeral coordinate system was103 modified as previously described, using the ends of the cross-pin placed perpendicular to the104 bicipital groove to recreate the epicondylar axis distally on the intramedullary rod.105 Tendon and joint displacement (TJD) measurements were used to calculate the moment arm106 (MA). Arnold ref107 The humeral rod was controlled using a guide which allowedproofrtheexecution of precise108 passive translations and rotations in all planes. One surgeon manipulated each humerus109 specimen for all TJD experiments (JDW).110 Reverse shoulder arthroplasty111 For the RSA configuration testing, a reverse shoulder prosthesis (Comprehensive, Zimmer-112 Biomet, Warsaw,JournalIN,USA)wasimpanted by an experienced surgeon through a deltopectoral113 approach. Tenotomy of the subsc pul ris was performed. The humerus was cut in 20°114 retroversion at the anatomic neck. A 36mm glenosphere was used in female cadavers and a 40115 mm glenopshere used f   male cadavers. This system has 5.2 mm of built in lateralization116 with use of the standard glenopsheres. The smallest polyethlene tray was used on the humeral117 side 25. The subscapularis was not repaired at the end of the procedure to simulate a118 subscapularis deficiency.119 Modeling of the tendon transfers120 All tendon transfers for this study were modeled to replicate the options available in clinical121 practice. Transferred muscles included: the Sternal Head of the Pectoralis Major (PM),122 Latissimus Dorsi (LD), and Teres Major (TM).  These muscles were modeled to insert into 3123 selected locations:

-	Supraspinatus (SSP): anterior part of the insertion site of the supraspinatus tendon on the greater tuberosity   - Subscapularis (SSC): insertion site of the subscapularis on the lesser tuberosity Therefore, 5 tendon-transfer pairs were modeled: PM-SSC, LD-SSP, LD-SSC, TM-SSP, TM-SSC.Tendon transfers were modeled by placing non-absorbable braided #5 sutures along the line of action of the transferred muscles from its origin to insertion (Fig. 2). Each suture was centered at the muscle origin midpoint as measured by the curvilinear distance of each muscle’s bony origin. The midpoint of the origin was ma ked and a drill hole/eye screw placed to allow passage of a cord. The PM, LD, and TM muscle tissue was then removed to allow the cord to track over the underlyingPrestructussimilar to the native muscle. The cord construct used to evaluate the PM transfer was passed under the conjoined tendon when testedon the intact shoulderJournalandabovetheconjoined tendon when tested with a RSA because of the risk of insufficient space for proper gliding of the transferred pectoralis major in a reversesetting.IRMA DeterminatiTJD experiments were performed on all specimen to model every tendon transfer variation. Joint displacement and tendon excursion were assessed throughout the arc of axial humeral rotation with the humerus at 0° of abduction for ea ch tendon transfer. The humerus was then repositioned to 90° of abduction in the plane of th e scapula. Tendon excursion and joint displacements were again assessed through an arc of axial humeral rotation. Experimental conditions were performed in triplicate to allow for conditioning of the residual soft tissues. The average moment arm from each of the three trials was utilized for statistical analysis.

IRMAs were computed based on the observed joint and tendon displacement. Tendon excursion is a function of both moment arm and joint rotation. The instantaneous moment arm (r) is related to tendon excursion (E) as well as joint rotation (?) (r = dE/d?).Axial rotation of the humerus was computed with Euler angles, which were captured from the experimental sensors. Custom electropotentiometers were used to measure tendon excursion. Both tendon excursion and joint displacement measurements were captured using Motion Monitor Software. These data points were plotted to fit a polynomial function using Matlabsoftware (Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA, USA), with a requirementproofthatthe root-mean-squareerror be < 0.5mm. The instantaneous IRMA for a specified a c r tati n of the humerus was computed at every 1°.Tendon transfer IRMAs were compared using a two-way repeated-value analysis of variance. Means and standard deviations of the IRMAs of the tendon pairs are reported with the arm at the side and with the arm abducted t 90°. A 2-way repeated measures ANOVA model was used to compare tendon transfe s, position of the arm and IRMA. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).Results (Table 1)Native ShoulderTendon transfers were shown to have a significant effect on IRMA (p < 0.001). With the
168 humerus adducted (Fig .3), the IRMA of the TM-SSP (14.1 mm ± 3.1 mm)169 was significantly greater than the IRMA of the LD-SSP (7.3 mm ± 1.2 mm; p < 0.001) or170 PM-SSC (7.1 mm ± 0.9 mm; p < 0.001). With the humerus abducted to 90° (Fig. 4), the171 IRMAs of the LD- SSP (30.0 mm ± 5.4 mm) and TM-SSP (28.4 mm ± 6.6 mm) were
172 significantly greater than the IRMA of the LD-SSC (10.3 mm ± 2.4 mm; p =0.03, p =0.007 )173 or TM-SSC (8.2 mm ± 1.1 mm; p = 0.001, p =0.04) or PM-SSC (5.5 mm ± 1.2 mm; p <174 0.001, p < 0.001).175 The effect of transferred tendons was significantly affected by the position of the humerus (P176 < .0001). With the shoulder at 90° of abduction, the IRMA of the LD-SSP (30.0 mm ± 10.1177 mm) and TM-SSP (28.4 mm ± 7 mm) were significantly greater than the IRMA with the178 humerus adducted to 0° (LD-SSP: 7.3 mm ± 1.4 mm, P= 0.004; TM-SSP : 14.1 mm ± 2.9179 mm, P= 0.03). However, the IRMAs of the PM, LD-SSC and TM-SSC remained relatively180 unaffected by the position of the humerus in abduction-adducti  n.181 Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty182 When tendon transfers were performed in conjunction with RSA, tendon transfers also183 significantly affected the evaluated IRMA (P < .0001). With the humerus adducted to the side184 (Fig .5), the IRMA of the PM-SSC (19.9 mm ± 6.4 mm) was significantly greater than the185 IRMA of the TM-SSC (4.7 mm ± 0.9 mm; p < 0.001) or LD-SSP (2.9 mm± 0.5 mm; p <186 0.001). With the humer  s abd  cted to 90° (Fig. 6), the IRMAs of the LD- SSP (31.8 mm ±187 11.2 mm), TM-SSP (26.2 mm ± 7.8 mm) and PM-SSC (22 mm ± 7.4 mm) were not188 significantly different. However, the IRMAs of the TM and LD transfers were significantly189 smaller when transferred to the SSC than to the SSP (14.4 mm ± 5.7 mm versus 26.2 mm ±190 5.8 mm, p=0.05 and 7.7 mm ± 2.7 mm versus 31.8 mm ± 10.1 mm, p=0.043 respectively).191 The IRMA of the native shoulder differed significantly from that of the RSA state for all192 tendon transfers (P < .0001). With the humerus adducted to the side of the body (Fig. 7), the193 IRMA of the RSA PM-SSC transfer was significantly greater than without an RSA (P <194 .0001), demonstrating increased efficiency for internal rotation in the RSA state.  In contrast,195 the IRMA of the TM-SSP was more advantageous in the native shoulder, with a significantly196 greater IRMA compared to the same tendon transfer after implantation with a RSA (P <
197 .0001). The IRMA of the LD-SSP remained relatively unchanged before and after RSA198 (P=0.09). With the shoulder abducted to 90° (Fig. 8 ), the IRMA of the PM-SSC with a RSA199 was significantly greater compared to a native shoulder (P < .0001) whereas the IRMA of the

LD-SSP and the TM-SSP were similar in both conditions (P=0.12 and P=0.09 respectively).DiscussionThis biomechanical study shows that in a native shoulder, transfer of the teres major and of the latissimus dorsi proximally to the anterior footprint proofthesupraspinatus (SSP) could efficiently restore active internal rotation, especially when the a m is abducted. In this position, the line of pull of the latissimus dorsi is directly e endicular to the axis of rotation of the humerus. Internal rotation with the arm abduct d is crucial to placing the arm behindthe back which is necessary for personal hygiene15, 24.The feasibility of transferringJournaltheteresmajor and latissimus dorsi has been evaluated in a cadaveric study . Further work by Elh sssan et al showed that the latissimus dorsi can betransferred anteriorly witho t isking impingement of the axillary or radial nerve. However, transfer of the teres maj may possibly lead to compression of the axillary nerve within the quadrangular space. Therefore, the safest and most effective option to restore the internal rotation motion 7arm after an irreparable tear of the subscapularis is the transfer of the latissimus dorsi proximally on the humeral head at the level of the anterior footprint of thesupraspinatus. This is supported by recent clinical studies14, 18 showing a statistically significant improvement in internal rotation from L5 to L1 in 29 patients after transfer of the latissimus dorsi anteriorly to the proximal portion of the lesser tuberosity.Long term follow-up studies on transfer of the sternal head of the pectoralis major below the conjoined tendon for irreparable tear of the subscapularis have reported satisfactory long-termresults.9, 17 In these studies, the indication for surgery was pain and loss of motion.

follow-up (19.7 years, 10 years respectively), the authors of both studies showed significant improvement in pain and range of motion (including internal rotation) after pectoralis major transfer. However, it is important to note that none of the patients complained of anterior instability prior to transfer. Unsatisfactory results after transfer of the pectoralis tendon havebeen reported when patients have concurrent anterior instability or subluxation 8, 19.Our biomechanical study shows that the IRMA of the pectoralis major transfer is inferior to that of the teres major with the arm on the side and both the teres major and latissimus dorsi with the arm at 90° of abduction when tested in the native shoulder. This is due to the fact thatthe native shoulder is an unconstrained joint and transfe ing the pect ralis major causes the head to translate anteriorly rather than purely internally otate. The pectoralis major transfer isable to restore internal rotation when the arm is plac d in maximum external rotation, but as soon as the arm moves to neutral rotation, the t ansfer is no longer efficient. Anteriortranslation may beJournalaccentuatedinpatients with concurrent loss of the anterior labrum and deficient glenohumeral ligame ts. In p tients without prior instability or subluxation, thenative tissues may contin e to p ovide resistance to instability and allow the pectoralis tendon to provide an anteri c mpressive force to counter balance the intact posterior rotator cuff. With loss of the anterior labrum, transfer of the pectoralis tendon may cause anterior subluxation an destabilize the centered compressive force to the glenohumeral joint. Therefore, in younger patients with a history of shoulder instability and an irreparable subscapularis, a latissimus dorsi transfer may be the preferred transfer to restore a posteriorly directed line of pull to avoid an anteriorly directed transfer force. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of the anterior labrum in the setting of tendon transfers for irreparable anterior rotator cuff tears.However, the biomechanics of this transfer do change after RSA. The RSA is a semi-constrained prosthesis and the humeral head does not translate anteriorly. Instead, all applied
247 forces are converted into rotational forces. Thus, the transfer of the sternal head of the248 pectoralis major becomes an efficient transfer to restore internal rotation. Several hypotheses249 have been proposed to explain the loss of internal rotation after RSA.  These include rotator250 cuff deficiency, alteration of the rotator cuff moment arm, poor scapulothoracic control and251 mechanical impingement.  Of these, the most commonly accepted explanation is that252 excessive medialization creates mechanical impingement between the scapular pillar and the253 humerus and decreases tension of the residual rotator cuff 3. This mechanical impingement254 has been confirmed by Rol et al21 as they have proven proofthatpostperative internal rotation255 above L3 was significantly associated with a greater glenosphe e  verhang. In the Rol el at256 series21 with no glenoid lateralization (which could  ossibly dec ease impingement between257 the humerus and scapular pillar) neither the condition    the subscapularis nor subscapularis258 repair were significantly associated with imp oved internal rotation. However, Collin et al5259 showed that internalJournalrotationinpatientswith a healed subscapularis tendon was significantly260 higher than in the patients with   ruptured repair after RSA with a lateralized glenosphere261 configuration. Therefore, t ansfer of the pectoralis major tendon may be an option to restore262 active internal rotati   in c  mbination with a lateralized glenosphere RSA when the263 subscapularis is irreparable. This transfer can easily be performed through a delto-pectoral264 approach by detaching the insertion from the lateral border of the bicipital groove and265 transferring it to the lesser tuberosity. Clinical studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.266 This biomechanical study is limited by several factors. First, IRMA’s were determined only267 for glenohumeral internal rotation. Clinically, internal rotation is the results of combined268 motions of both the glenohumeral joint as well as the scapulothoracic articulation. Based on269 this model, we are unable to assess the effect of these tendon transfers when the scapula is not270 a fixed structure. Second, the IRMA was only calculated for the transferred tendon.  This did271 not take into account the volume of muscle generating the force, which can affect the IRMA.
272 Additionally, this study was limited to a small number of cadaveric specimens, which may273 have affected the results. Due to these limitations, the number of variables evaluated in our274 statistical model was limited to comparing tendon transfer pairs that were deemed to be275 clinically relevant. Third, the transferred muscles each have broad origins. The simplification276 of reproducing the line of pull from the center of the muscular origin may not replicate the in-277 vivo function of these tendon transfers.  However, we felt this was necessary to simplify the278 comparisons maintain clinically meaningful results. Lastly, the effects of surgical technique,279 tendon mobilization, length-tension relationships, and glenohumeral stability were not280	addressed with this model.  Even with these limitations, the	bserved differences between281 transfers were great enough to achieve statistical significance using a modeling strategy which282 accounted for repeated measures. This study should s rve as a foundation for future283 biomechanical studies on the effect of tendon t ansfer to restore internal rotation to the284 glenohumeral joint.285286 Conclusion287 Tendon transfers to rest  re sho  lder internal rotation differ in effectiveness and may be288 affected by arm position and by implantation of RSA. LD potentially results in superior289 restoration of shoulder internal rotation in a native shoulder (given the risk of nerve290 compression with the TM transfer) compared to PM and should be considered as a potential291 tendon transfer to restore internal rotation in selected patients. In combination with a RSA, the292 fulcrum provided by the biomechanics of the semi-constrained implant allows the PM transfer293 to become more efficient tendon transfer to restore active internal rotation.294295 Acknowledgments
