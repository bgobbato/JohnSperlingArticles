Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with inferior clinical outcomes after surgical management of many orthopedic conditions. The purpose of this systematic review was to define the clinical, functional, and patient-reported outcomes of shoulder arthroplasty (SA) in patients with PD.Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search was completed using the Ovid platform for searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews, with additional searches in Web of Sci-ence and Scopus. Included studies were full-length, English-language, clinical investigations reporting on SA in patients with PD with at least one clinical outcome.Results: Seven studies including 7126 patients (7134 SA) met inclusion criteria with a mean age of 72.6 (range, 69.5e75.8 years), 58.9% female, and the average follow-up duration was 65 months (range, 17 e119 months). Anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) was the most reported implant surgery (n ? 3455, 48.4%) followed by hemiarthroplasty (HA) (n ? 2840, 39.8%), and reverse shoulder arthro-plasty (RSA) (n ? 839,1.8%). SA consistently improved pain. Forward elevation, abduction, and external rotation had a pooled mean increase of 36 , 20 , and 6 , respectively. Complications occurred at a pooled rate of 22.5%, with stiffness (7.1%), need for revision (5.3%), and instability (4.7%) as the most common complications reported. Reoperations inclusive of revisions occurred at a lower pooled rate of 5.6%, with aTSA (n ? 201; 9.0%) having the highest rate, followed by HA (n ? 158; 7.1%), and then RSA (n ? 42; 1.9%). Conclusions: The results of the present systematic review demonstrate that SA in patients with PD results in consistent pain relief. However, inferior improvements in clinical outcomes may be expected when compared with patients without PD, likely due to the neurodegenerative manifestations of this disorder. In addition, RSA had a lower reoperation rate than HA and aTSA in patients with PD.© 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons.

   Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurode-generative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease.8 The annual inci-dence of PD is 20.5 cases per 100,000 individuals, with a lifetime risk of 2% in men and 1.3% in women.8,11 Disease onset typically follows a progressive course after 50 years of age with a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms.13 Motor symptoms include brady-kinesia, muscle rigidity, flexed posture, asymmetric limb resting tremor, and postural instability, while nonmotor symptoms are cognitive impairment and depression.13,16Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board approved this study (PR12-007498-04). *Corresponding author: John W.

   In orthopedics, prior investigations have demonstrated suc-cessful pain relief but marginal functional benefits and increased perioperative complications after total knee and hip arthroplasties in patients with PD.12,14,17 The limited functional results after lower limb arthroplasty were attributed to certain clinical disease symptoms, such as severe tremor, preexisting muscle rigidity, and dystonia.1,12 ,14,17 Although most of the arthroplasty studies in pa-tients with PD has been conducted on the lower extremity, the upper extremity is more commonly involved with tremor and choreiform movement.6 As such, some have proposed even greater rates of failure and complication rates in patients with PD after shoulder arthroplasty (SA).7,9,10   The current literature evaluating SA in patients with PD is generally limited to small retrospective studies and case reports.9,10

Publications available to date do suggest that patients with PD are at higher risk for complications after any type of SA because of the various motor, cognitive, and metabolic factors arising from the neurodegenerative pathology.5 However, characterizing and comparing the perioperative complications in patients with PD undergoing SA has been difficult because of the relatively low incidence of these procedures in patients with the disease. As such, the purpose of this study was to systematically review the evidence in the current literature to evaluate the clinical, functional, and patient-reported outcomes of SA in patients with PD.MethodsLiterature search   This systematic review investigating the outcomes of PD in SA was conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta analyses) 27-item checklist (Fig. 1). The comprehensive literature review was completed on June 8, 2021, using MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane, Web of Sci-ence, and Scopus library databases. Search terms included “Par-kinson’s disease”, “Parkinson’s”, “shoulder arthroplasty”, “shoulder replacement”, “hemiarthroplasty”, “anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty”, and “reverse total shoulder arthroplasty”. The formal
strategy listing all search terms used and how they are combined is included in the Supplementary Appendix S1.Eligibility criteria and study selection   The inclusion criteria consisted of full-length publications written in the English language, publication in a peer-reviewed journal, level IV evidence or higher, and presence of at least 1 re-ported clinical outcome (common shoulder functional outcomes, complications, reoperations, or readmission). Exclusions entailed abstract-only reports, case reports, expert opinions, literature re-views, and studies with no reported outcomes.Data extraction   The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experi-enced librarian with input from the study investigators. Study de-mographics were subsequently collected by 2 blinded reviewers. These included the articles' author, publication year, study design, and level of evidence. Further patient-specific characteristics collected included sample size, mean age, sex, follow-up interval, arthroplasty type, functional outcome data, radiographic outcome data, complication rates, reoperations, and patient-reported outcome measures.

Statistical analysis   Statistical analysis was performed with the combination of Microsoft Excel (Version 16.0.1; Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) and JMP Pro (Version 14.1.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Descriptive statistics were presented as means, medians, percent-ages, and standard deviation when appropriate. Continuous vari-ables were analyzed using Student t tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-square analysis or Fisher exact tests. When available, raw data were extracted and reported as pooled means if possible. Investigations with individual raw patient data without means and standard deviations were manually included into Microsoft Excel for inclusion into the final calculations. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsStudy characteristics and patient demographics   The initial literature search resulted in 29 total studies. No du-plicates were present, and all 29 studies were screened for inclu-sion and exclusion criteria. Subsequently, 17 unique studies were identified as potentially relevant, and full texts were assessed for eligibility. Seven clinical studies met criteria to be included in this systematic review, as demonstrated in Figure 1. A total of 7134 shoulders in 7126 patients were included in the analysis. Mean patient age at the time of arthroplasty was 72.6 (range, 69.5 e 75.8) years, 58.9% were female, and the average follow-up duration was 65 months (range, 17 e 119 months). Anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) was the most reported implant procedure (n ? 3455, 48.4%), followed by hemiarthroplasty (HA) (n ? 2840, 39.8%), and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) (n ? 839, 11.8%) (Table I).Clinical and functional outcome measures   Six out of the seven studies (n ? 102) reported pain as an outcome measure, all reporting general improvement after SA (Table II).2,4,5,7,9,10 Three studies (n ? 30) measured forward elevation, with a pooled postoperative mean of 75 .2,4,5 Of these investigations, two had preoperative data available demonstrating a pooled mean increase of 36 postoperatively.2,4 Five studies (n ? 99) measured abduction, with a pooled postoperative mean 97 and a mean increase of 20 postoperatively.2,4,7,9,10 Six studies (n ? 102) measured external rotation, with a pooled postoperative mean of 27 and a mean increase of 6 postoperatively.2,4, 5,7,9,10 Five studies (n ? 99) measured internal rotation with various reporting scales, none demonstrated any significant improvements from baseline (Table II).2,4,7,9,10   Cusick et al4 (n ? 10) was the only study to report American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES) and simple shoulder test outcomes with a mean improvement of 33.7 to 51.0 (P ? .047)
and 1.3 to 3.8 (P ? .024), respectively. Borbas et al2 (n ? 17) was the only study to report SSV, absolute Constant-Murley score, and relative Constant-Murley bow score with mean improvements of 33.9 to 57.8 (P ? .005), 26.8 to 48.7 (P < .001), and 35 to 61.5 (P < .001), respectively. Three studies (n ? 66) reported outcome measures using the Neer result rating scale, with pooled categories of 24% excellent, 26% satisfactory, and 50% unsatisfactory.7,9,10Shoulder-related complications, reoperations, and revisions   All studies reported on postoperative complications with a pooled rate of 22.5% (1607/7134) (Table III). Stiffness was the most common pooled complication (n ? 505; 7.1%), followed by an un-listed need for revision (n ? 381; 5.3%), and then instability (n ? 381; 4.7%). When tiered by implant, stiffness, need for revision, and instability remained the top three categories for HA, TSA, and RSA (Table IV). Reoperations inclusive of revisions occurred at a pooled rate of 5.6% (401/7134), with revisions accounting for 398 of 401 reoperations also occurring at a pooled rate of 5.6%. When categorized by implants, aTSA had the highest reoperation rate (n ? 201; 9.0%) followed by HA (n ? 158; 7.1%), and then RSA (n ? 42; 1.9%).Discussion   PD is a neurodegenerative disorder that presents a clinical challenge with respect to surgical management of orthopedic conditions, including SA. Studies examining outcomes of SA in PD are scarce, with the available data limited to smaller retrospective investigations. The results of our systematic review indicate that SA provided patients with PD adequate pain relief. However, func-tional benefits after SA remained limited, with small increases in ROM and marginal patient-reported outcome improvements. Complications occurred at a pooled rate of 22.5%, with stiffness (7.1%), need for revision (5.3%), and instability (4.7%) as the most common issues. Despite this, reoperations inclusive of revisions occurred at a lower pooled rate of 5.6%, with aTSA (9.0%) having the highest rate, followed by HA (7.1%), and RSA (1.9%) with the lowest rate.   The clinical studies included in this review all demonstrated improvement in pain after SA. Koch et al7 first evaluated the effects of SA in 15 PD patients, demonstrating discouraging functional results but reasonable success in pain relief after unconstrained aTSA. In a further review of subsequent studies with matched co-horts, Cusick et al4 demonstrated similar postoperative VAS pain and ASES pain scores of PD patients to a matched RSA cohort. Similarly, Borbas et al2 observed equivalent pain improvement after RSA in patients with PD compared with their matched cohort. Unlike pain relief, functional improvement in this cohort has his-torically been poor.7 In the present review, forward elevation had a pooled postoperative mean of 75 with mean increases of

abduction to 36 and external rotation to 6 , with these differences remaining below the described minimal clinically important dif-ferences after TSA and RSA.15   In addition, patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction were also marginal. In studies including the Neer rating scale, up to 50% of SA had an unsatisfactory result, notably implants included were either HA or aTSA.7,9,10 Despite this, some benefits after RSA have been reported by Cusick et al,4 with improvements of ASES and simple shoulder test similar to matched controls. Borbas et al2 also noticed improvement in SSV, absolute Constant-Murley score, and relative Constant-Murley bow score but at lower postoperative values than matched RSA controls. These outcomes are likely affected by the poor muscle control, rigidity, and bradykinesia of PD, which may limit the ability of SA and associated implants to improve the compromised shoulder girdle. To combat this, modi-fications of the surgical technique to include appropriate soft-tissue releases, optimized component positioning, early mobilization, prolonged physical therapy, and botulinum toxin A use have been described with unclear benefits.2-5,7,9,10   In this review, complications remained a notable problem, with a pooled rate of 22.5%. Postoperative stiffness was the most often described complication, at a rate of 7.1%, which is consistent with the ROM findings in the literature. Although soft-tissue tension and component positioning play a role in subsequent ROM, the ability to successfully engage in physical therapy likely also contributes to the outcome. As such, the combination of rigidity, bradykinesia, and dementia may translate into a limited ceiling for postoperative ROM improvements in these patients. Instability was also observed at an elevated rate of 4.7%. Initial investigations highlighted that this may be an issue limited to unconstrained SA, but more recent studies including this review continued to demonstrate higher rates of instability in RSA as well.2,4 As patients with PD have asynchronous motor function, constant tremors, and lack complete volitional muscle control, this may place the shoulder at elevated risks of implant loosening and instability events.   In the present review, reoperations inclusive of revisions occurred at a pooled rate of 5.6%, with revision arthroplasty ac-counting for 99.3% of described reoperations (398 of 401). In studies with matched cohorts, PD demonstrated higher reoperation rates than their respective RSA control groups.2 ,4 Similarly, Burrus et al3 demonstrated an independent increase in revision rates after HA, aTSA, and RSA when compared with matched controls in a large national database investigation. In a review of their in-dications for revisions, they included traditionally common reasons for revision SA: instability, infection, periprosthetic fracture, and component loosening. As such, the observed increased risk of complications in patients with PD remains multifactorial and likely stems from the underlying manifestations of the disease, including the motor and nonmotor components. Interestingly, when reop-eration was compared by implant type, RSA demonstrated a lower pooled rate of 1.9% than the 9.0% in aTSA and 7.1% in HA. This may suggest that RSA may be more accommodating of PD with respect to subsequent revision. However, this outcome may also be limited by the shorter follow-up of RSA studies because of the more recent introduction of the implant as compared to HA and aTSA.   Although this systematic review provides a broad overview of SA in the context of PD, it should be viewed within the context of certain limitations. The present investigation limited the search to articles with full text published in the English language, which may have resulted in exclusion of other relevant literature as well as potential selection bias. Subsequently, this study included many heterogenous retrospective studies spanning multiple decades with different numbers of patients, follow-up intervals, measured clinical outcomes, and varied implant use with unknown details on the surgical indications. In addition, most of the included patients

were acquired from the study by Burrus et al,3 which heavily in-fluences the current analysis, especially the rates of complications and revision surgery. Therefore, it was difficult to consistently pool all variables to generate a complete meta-analysis. As such, the present investigation performed a qualitative systematic review with quantitative calculations whenever feasible.Conclusion   The results of the present systematic review demonstrate that SA in patients with PD likely results in consistent pain relief. However, inferior improvements in clinical outcomes may be expected, likely due to the neurodegenerative manifestations of
this disorder. An elevated rate of complications was observed in the literature with a pooled rate of 22.5%. However, revisions were much lower with a 5.6% pooled rate. RSA may be the most accommodating implant type to PD, with a lower rate of revisions.Disclaimers:Funding: No funding was disclosed by the authors.Conflicts of interest: The authors, their immediate families, and any research foundation with which they are affiliated have not received any financial payments or other benefits from any com-mercial entity related to the subject of this article.
