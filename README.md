Background: The relative indications of anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) continue to evolve. Some surgeons favor RSA over TSA for elderly patients with primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis (GHOA) and an intact rotator cuff due to fear of a postoperative (secondary) rotator cuff tear in this age group. However, RSA is associated with unique com-plications and a worse functional arc of motion compared with TSA. Therefore, it is important to understand the clinical outcomes and rates of revision surgery and secondary rotator cuff tears in elderly patients undergoing TSA.

Methods: Between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, 377 consecutive TSAs were performed for primary GHOA in 340 patients 70 years of age or older. The mean age at surgery was 76.2 years (standard deviation [SD], 4.9). Clinical evaluation included pain, mo-tion, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score. Radiographs were reviewed for preoperative morphology and postoperative complications. All complications and reoperations were recorded. The average clinical follow-up time was 3.3 years (SD, 2.0). Statis-tical analyses were performed, and Kaplan-Meier implant survival estimates were calculated. For all analyses, a P value <.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results: The mean pain visual analog scale and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score at the final follow-up were 1.6 (SD, 2.2) and 78.0 (SD, 17.8), respectively. Forward elevation and external rotation increased from 96 (SD, 30 ) and 26 (SD, 20 ) preoperatively to 160 (SD, 32 ) and 64 (SD, 26 ) postoperatively (P < .001 for each). The percentage of patients who had internal rotation to L5 or greater increased from 24.8% preoperatively to 71.8% postoperatively (P < .001). Revision surgery was performed in 3 shoulders (0.8%), and the 5-year implant survival estimate was 98.9% (95% confidence interval: 97.3%-100%). There were 3 medical (0.8%), 10 minor surgical (2.7%), and 5 major surgical (1.3%) complications. No shoulder had radiographic evidence of humeral component loosening, whereas 7 (2%) had evidence of some degree of glenoid component loosening. In total, there were 5 secondary rotator cuff tears (1.3%), of which 2 (0.5%) required revision surgery.

Conclusion: Elderly patients with primary GHOA and an intact rotator cuff have excellent clinical and radiographic outcomes after

  Shoulder arthroplasty has increased in incidence in recent decades due to technical improvements and clinical success.9,15,23,35 This trend has been particularly true in the elderly, for whom the incidence has increased at the greatest rate.25

  Historically, anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) has been the standard surgical indication for patients with primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis (GHOA) and an intact and functioning rotator cuff.7,18 Conversely, the more highly constrained reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) has been reserved for those patients without a functioning ro-tator cuff.5,32

  Because of the overall success of RSA in patients with defective rotator cuffs, however, the surgical indications for RSA have expanded to include other conditions, such as primary GHOA with severe bone loss or soft-tissue imbalance, complex fractures, tumor, and avascular ne-crosis, regardless of the presence of a functioning rotator cuff.5,8 In fact, some centers have reported that more than 50% of their primary shoulder arthroplasties are now per-formed using RSA.4

  Recently, some surgeons have recommended consid-ering RSA over the historically indicated TSA for elderly patients with primary GHOA and an intact rotator cuff.27,29,32,33 This choice seems mostly to be due to the fear of future rotator cuff dysfunction in these elderly pa-tients, termed a secondary rotator cuff tear, which might lead to revision surgery after anatomic TSA.10,34

  The choice of RSA over TSA in patients with intact rotator cuffs is not without potential adverse consequences, however, as RSA is associated with certain unique com-plications not seen in TSA. These complications include acromial and scapular spine fractures, inferior glenoid notching, and subcoracoid impingement.11,20 Some authors have also found a higher rate of deep infection in patients undergoing RSA when compared with TSA.16,21 In addi-tion, restoration of motion seems to be superior with anatomic TSA, especially in terms of internal rotation.

   When making the decision between TSA and RSA in elderly patients with primary GHOA and an intact rotator cuff, it would be important for the surgeon to understand the expected outcomes of the historically indicated TSA in this population. However, to date, few studies have reported these outcomes. Therefore, we conducted a study on elderly patients with primary GHOA and an intact rotator cuff who underwent TSA at our institution. The purpose of the study was to determine the clinical and radiographic outcomes in




elderly patients with primary GHOA undergoing anatomic TSA as well as the rates of complications, secondary ro-tator cuff tears, and revision surgeries in this population.


Materials and methods

Patient selection

This was a retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data from our Institutional Total Joint Registry database. All consenting patients 70 years or older who underwent a primary anatomic TSA for primary GHOA by 1 of 2 fellowship-trained shoulder and elbow surgeons between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, were included in the study. The age of 70 was chosen for this study as this age is frequently cited in the literature as the cutoff beyond which RSA should be considered.14,32,33 Rotator cuff integrity was confirmed on preoperative clinical assessment and at the time of surgery.

Surgical technique and postoperative protocol

All surgeries were performed at our tertiary care referral center. Patients underwent primary TSA via a deltopectoral approach with a subscapularis tenotomy. The subscapularis tendon was repaired with multiple interrupted heavy simple absorbable su-tures. For patients with glenoid anteversion or retroversion of up to 15 , eccentric reaming was used to normalize the version; neither bone grafting nor augmented glenoid components were used. Postoperatively, a shoulder immobilizer was worn for 6 weeks. Patients were seen in clinic at 6 weeks and 1 year postoperatively. They were then invited to return for a physical evaluation and radiographs at 2 and 5 years postoperatively, and every 5 years thereafter. For patients unable to physically return to our institution, shoulder evaluations were completed using mailed or telephone questionnaires, and radiographs were also requested.

Complications and reoperations

All postoperative complications and reoperations were recorded. Complications were classified as medical or surgical, with surgical complications further categorized as minor if no change in man-agement was required or major if a change in management was required. Complications listed in our Institutional Total Joint Registry database were confirmed with review of the electronic medical record. Revision surgeries were identified from the database and confirmed both through review of the electronic medical record and radiographically.

Radiographic analysis

Radiographs were reviewed to analyze preoperative glenohumeral morphology and postoperative implant changes. For each shoul-der, 5 radiographs were collected: the preoperative, 6-week postoperative, and final postoperative axillary radiographs as well as the 6-week and final postoperative Grashey radiographs in external rotation. When preoperative axillary radiographs were not available or inadequate (18 shoulders), axial slices from preop-erative computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imag-ing scans were used if available (12 shoulders).

   All imaging studies were reviewed by the 2 senior authors concurrently, and a consensus opinion on the radiographic findings was achieved. Preoperative radiographs were evaluated for gleno-humeral morphology. Postoperative radiographs were evaluated for humeral head anterior, posterior, and/or superior subluxation, as well as dislocation, fracture, and glenoid or humeral component loosening.

   Preoperative glenoid morphology was classified according to the modified Walch classification.2,31 Pre- and postoperative humeral head subluxation was classified according to direction and graded mild, moderate, or severe according to Torchia et al.28 Postoperative glenoid and humeral component radiolucencies were graded ac-cording to Lazarus et al13 and Sperling et al,26 respectively.

   For determining the presence of a secondary rotator cuff tear, advanced imaging was obtained in postoperative patients who reported a new onset of shoulder pain or were found to have loss of motion, loss of strength, or glenohumeral instability on physical examination. For these patients, the rotator cuff was evaluated via an advanced imaging study (ultrasound or CT arthrogram) and intraoperatively at the time of revision surgery, when performed.

Range of motion and clinical scores

Preoperative range of motion values (forward elevation in the scapular plane and external and internal rotation with the shoulder adducted) were obtained from preoperative clinic notes and postoperatively either from the electronic medical record or from patient-completed questionnaires. Postoperative visual analog scale (VAS), defined as a patient’s average daily pain, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores were calculated for each patient who had completed at least 1 ques-tionnaire. When a given patient had completed multiple ques-tionnaires, only the most recent responses were included.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t-test for nu-merical data, the c2 test for nonpaired categorical data, and McNemar’s test for paired categorical data. Kaplan-Meier esti-mates of implant survival free from revision at 1, 2, and 5 years were calculated. Patients were also analyzed accordingly.

Results

Patient demographic information

There were 377 anatomic TSAs performed in 340 patients who met inclusion criteria. Demographic information is listed in Table I.


Preoperative radiology

There were 370 shoulders (98.1%) that had sufficient pre-operative imaging to assess glenohumeral morphology (Table II). The majority of shoulders (288; 77.8%) had some degree of preoperative glenoid bone loss (Walch types A2, B2, or B3) apparent on preoperative radiographs. There were 145 shoulders (39.2%) with some degree of preoperative posterior humeral head subluxation and 12 shoulders (3.2%) with some degree of preoperative anterior humeral head subluxation. No shoulders had superior hu-meral head migration on preoperative radiographs.

Operative details and follow-up

Operative details are listed in Table III. Postoperatively, the average clinical follow-up was 3.3 years (standard devia-tion [SD], 2.0). No patients were lost to follow-up. There were 302 patients (88.8%) with 2-year follow-up and 51 (15.0%) who had died after their TSA. None of the deaths were related to the index surgery.

Complications and revisions

All patients had complete clinical information documented, including complications and revision surgeries when rele-vant. There were 18 total complications, of which 3 were medical (0.8%), 10 were minor surgical (2.7%), and 5 were major surgical (1.3%) complications (Table IV).

  There were 3 intraoperative fractures (0.8%), 2 of which involved the greater tuberosity and 1 involved the anterior humeral cortex. All 3 fractures were nondisplaced and fixed at the time of the index procedure with a nonabsorbable suture. Postoperative management was not altered for these patients, and none of these 3 shoulders had radiographic evidence of component loosening or required a subsequent revision surgery.

  The major surgical complications included 3 disloca-tions, 1 deep infection that was treated with long-term suppressive antibiotics, and 1 periprosthetic humeral shaft fracture due to a mechanical fall that was treated success-fully in a fracture brace.

  There were 3 revision surgeries (0.8%). Two revision surgeries were performed for anterosuperior escape (described below) and 1 revision surgery was performed for posterior instability at 7 days postoperatively. The patient who developed posterior instability had a B3 glenoid and severe posterior humeral head subluxation preoperatively. All revision surgeries were conversion to RSA. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival free from revision sur-gery was 98.9% (Table V).

   In total, there were 5 secondary rotator cuff tears (1.3%). Two (0.5%) had subscapularis failure presenting with anterosuperior escape at 6 and 24 months postoperatively and were revised to RSA. The other 3 (0.8%) presented
   
4
with worsening clinical function at 5 months, 6 years, and 7 years postoperatively and were diagnosed with secondary rotator cuff tears on advanced imaging but deferred surgical intervention. Of these three patients, two completed post-operative questionnaires and reported an average VAS of 1.5 and average ASES score of 72.5.



  In terms of component loosening, no shoulder was considered to have radiographic evidence of humeral component loosening and 7 (2.0%) had some evidence of glenoid component loosening at the final radiographic follow-up. There were no instances of complete implant failures. There was no correlation between shoulders with preoperative humeral head subluxation and those with postoperative humeral head subluxation or glenoid component loosening.

Range of motion

There were 227 shoulders (60.2%) with complete preop-erative and postoperative range of motion data. Forward elevation and external rotation increased from a mean of 96 (SD, 30 ) and 26 (SD, 20 ) preoperatively to 160 (SD, 32 ) and 64 (SD, 26 ) postoperatively (P < .001 for each). The percentage of shoulders that had internal rota-tion to L5 or greater increased from 24.8% preoperatively to 71.8% postoperatively (P < .001).

Clinical scores

There were 253 shoulders (67.1%) that had at least 1 recorded postoperative VAS score and 211 (56.0%) that had reported at least 1 recorded postoperative ASES score. The mean VAS was 1.6 (SD, 2.2) and the mean ASES score was 78.0 (SD, 17.8). For VAS, 55% of respondents reported 0/



10 pain and only 6.3% of respondents reported 5/10 pain (Fig. 1, A). For ASES scores, 55% of respondents reported ASES scores 80 and only 9.4% reported ASES scores 50 (Fig. 1, B). VAS and ASES scores were tightly correlated (R2 ? 0.74). There was no correlation between follow-up length and VAS or ASES score (R2 < 0.02 for both).


Age-based analysis

When comparing patients in the cohort who were 70-79 years old at the time of their surgery with those who were 80 years or older, we found that the younger group had statistically significant shorter hospital lengths of stay and a lower rate of revision surgery. The rate of complications (medical, minor surgical, and major surgical) was higher in the older age group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There was no difference in VAS or ASES scores between the 2 groups (Table VI).


Discussion

The high rate of satisfactory reported outcomes after pri-mary RSA for multiple indications, coupled with concerns regarding the possibility of late cuff failure after anatomic TSA, has prompted recommendations by some for univer-sal implantation of RSA in patients older than 70 with primary GHOA and an intact rotator cuff.27,29,32,33 The results of our study indicate that anatomic TSA performed with contemporary implants and surgical techniques is

associated with excellent clinical and radiographic out-comes, low reoperation rates, and favorable implant sur-vival free of revision at 5 years (Fig. 2). Secondary rotator cuff tears in this population are rare despite their age. As such, it provides data to support the value of anatomic TSA in this particular patient population.

  Our study found that the incidence of symptomatic secondary rotator cuff tears in the elderly population after TSA was relatively low. In total, 5 shoulders were consid-ered to have developed symptomatic secondary rotator cuff tears (1.3%) in our cohort, and only 2 shoulders (0.5%) required revision surgery, whereas the other 3 had accept-able function and deferred surgical management.

   Although it is true that older patients in general have higher rates of rotator cuff tears than younger patients, it may not be true that older patients are at higher risk of a secondary rotator cuff tear than younger patients after anatomic TSA. For one, as rotator cuff tears and GHOA infrequently coexist despite both being common, the group of older patients with primary GHOA may not have the same high rate of a rotator cuff tears as similarly aged patients without GHOA. Also, the lower activity levels associated with older age may be pro-tective of secondary rotator cuff tears after TSA, as some studies have demonstrated that younger, more active patients are actually at higher risk of requiring revision
arthroplasty.3,6,12,17,19,22,24,30

  We did find that there was a progression of anterior and superior humeral head subluxation rates between first postoperative radiographs and final radiographs. These radiographic findings may be indicative of anterosuperior rotator cuff thinning or dysfunction over time. However, no correlation could be identified between proximal or anterior humeral head migration and a decrease in VAS or ASES scores, indicating that, even if radiographic anterior and superior subluxation is considered to be a surrogate of progressive rotator cuff wear, this radiographic finding in isolation may have limited clinical impact.


  Others have similarly reported excellent clinical out-comes in elderly patients who have undergone anatomic TSA for primary GHOA with intact rotator cuffs. Wright et al33 retrospectively reviewed 102 patients over 70 years old with primary GHOA and an intact rotator cuff who had TSA. Of the 45% who reported clinical outcomes, the average postoperative VAS was 0.7 and the ASES score was 86.33

  How one defines a secondary rotator cuff failure after TSA influences the reported cuff dysfunction rate. In our study, we evaluated for secondary rotator cuff tears in pa-tients presenting with new symptoms with advanced im-aging (ultrasound or CT arthrogram). We defined secondary rotator cuff tears this way such that our results would be clinically focused and meaningfully contribute to patient care. The clinical relevance of radiographic evidence of rotator cuff thinning in an otherwise well-functioning TSA, in our opinion, is limited and should not guide treatment recommendations or, by extension, the counseling of sur-gical candidates preoperatively.

  Others have used superior humeral head migration on routine postoperative plain radiograph as the definition of a secondary rotator cuff tear, regardless of patient symp-tomatology. Unsurprisingly, higher rates of secondary ro-tator cuff tears have been found in these studies.33,34 For instance, Young et al34 reviewed TSAs with 5-year radio-graphic follow-up for secondary rotator dysfunction, which they defined as moderate or severe superior subluxation on radiographs. Of the 518 patients with complete radio-graphic follow-up, they reported a 16.8% rate of secondary rotator cuff dysfunction.34 However, just one of these 87 shoulders required a revision to RSA due to the cuff dysfunction despite all of them being diagnosed with sec-ondary rotator cuff failure, according to this criterion.34 Although proximal migration on routine radiographs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may indicate rotator cuff thinning, we do not believe that this isolated radiographic finding is indicative of cuff dysfunction or a surgical fail-ure, as these patients maintain good clinical function.

  When comparing patients in our cohort who were 80 years or older at the time of their surgery with those who were 70-79 years old, we found that patients in the older group had the same VAS and ASES scores despite a higher revision surgery rate (Table VI). Other studies that have evaluated the outcomes of anatomic TSA in patients over the age of 80 specifically have also found excellent clinical scores and low revision surgery rates. For instance, Iriberri et al10 reviewed 32 TSAs in patients over 80 and found an average postoperative subjective shoulder value of 81% with no revision surgeries. Foruria et al7 reviewed 50 TSAs in patients over 80 and found 80% excellent or satisfactory results and an average VAS of 1.8 with 3 revision surgeries for anterosuperior humeral head subluxation. Triplet et al29 reviewed 18 TSAs in patients older than 80 and an average ASES of 91 and VAS of 0. Combined with our results, these data show that anatomic TSA in elderly patients with
  
Anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty in the elderly



GHOA, even for those over 80, results in excellent func-tional outcomes with low revision surgery rates.

  In our practice, we do perform a large number of RSAs in elderly patients with primary GHOA, but we base the selection of RSA on the severity of glenoid bone loss, the degree of posterior humeral subluxation, and the occasional presence of associated cuff tears. However, in patients with an intact rotator cuff and lesser degrees of bone loss or subluxation, we do not consider age 70 or older an indi-cation to perform RSA in primary GHOA.

Limitations

Readers of this study should be aware of several limita-tions when interpreting our results. First, there was no control group with which our patients were compared. It would have been better to compare these patients with a similar cohort that underwent RSA, but this is not stan-dard practice at our institution. We used preoperative axillary view radiographs instead of CT scans to deter-mine glenoid morphology. Although CT is considered a gold standard, a previous study did demonstrate that intraobserver agreement on the Walch classification based on plain radiographs is comparable to that based on CT.1 Preoperative range of motion was determined by the surgeon in clinic, whereas postoperative range of motion was determined by a combination of surgeon assessment and patient questionnaires, meaning that this was not truly a direct comparison. Lastly, functional scores were not routinely obtained preoperatively, and so we were unable to calculate pre- to postoperative change in VAS and ASES scores.



Conclusions


Elderly patients with primary GHOA and an intact ro-tator cuff have excellent radiographic, functional, and clinical outcomes after anatomic TSA with low complication rates. Secondary rotator cuff failures and revision surgeries are both infrequent within the first 5 postoperative years. Despite recent trends, in our opinion, age greater than 70 should not be considered an indication in and of itself for RSA over TSA in patients with primary GHOA. To the contrary, older age may be associated with lower rates of implant failure and revi-sion surgery compared with younger patients undergoing TSA.

1	Abstract

2	Background:Loss of active shoulder internal rotation can be very disabling. Several tendon

3	transfers have been described for management of an irreparable subscapularis tear. The

4	purpose of this study was to determine and compare the internal rotation moment

5	arm(IRMA)of the sternal head of the pectoralis major(PM),latissimus dorsi(LD) and teres

6	major(TM)when transferred to different insertion sites to restore shoulder internal rotation

7	with and without reverse shoulder arthroplasty(RSA).

8	Methods:Six fresh-frozen right hemithoraces were prepared and evaluated using a custom

9	tendon transfer model to determine IRMA of different tend  n t ansfers using the tendon and

10	joint displacement method. Five tendon-transfer pairs we e modeled using a single suture and

11	tested before and after implantation of a RSA(Compr h nsive, Biomet, Warsaw IN,

12	USA):PM to the insertion site of the subscapula is(SSC),LD to the anterior insertion site of

13	the supraspinatus tendon on the greater tuberosity(SSP),LD to SSC,TM to SSP and TM to

14	SSC. The subscapularis was	ot rep ired	t the end of the RSA procedure to simulate a

15	subscapularis deficiency. The PM transfer was passed under the conjoined tendon when tested

16	on the intact shoulder and above the conjoined tendon when tested with a RSA.

17	Results:Tendon transfers were shown to have a significant effect on IRMA. The effect of

18	transferred tendons was significantly affected by the position of the humerus. With the

19	humerus adducted the IRMA of the TM-SSP(14.1mm±3.1mm)was significantly greater than

20	the other transfers. With the humerus abducted to 90° the IRMAs of the LD-

21	SSP(30.0mm±5.4mm) and TM-SSP(28.4mm±6.6mm)were sign ificantly greater than the

22	IRMA of other transfer options.  The IRMA of the native shoulder differed significantly from

23	that of the RSA state for all tendon transfers. With the humerus adducted to the side of the

24	body the IRMA of the RSA PM-SSC transfer was significantly greater than without an
 
25	RSA(19. mm±6.4mm vs 7.1mm±0.9mm),demonstrating incr eased efficiency for internal

26	rotation in the RSA state.

27	Conclusion:Tendon transfers to restore shoulder internal rotation differ in effectiveness and

28	may be affected by arm position and by implantation of a lateralized humerus/lateralized

29	glenoid RSA. LD potentially results in superior restoration of shoulder internal rotation in a

30	native shoulder (given the risk of nerve compression with the TM transfer)compared to PM

31	and should be considered as a potential tendon transfer to restore internal rotation in selected

32	patients. In combination with a lateralized humerus/lateralized glen  id RSA, the fulcrum

33	provided by the biomechanics of the semi-constrained implant all  ws the PM transfer to

34	become a more efficient tendon transfer to restore active inte nal rotation.

40	Loss of active shoulder internal rotation can be very disabling. The most common cause of

41	loss of internal rotation is irreparable tearing of the subscapularis tendon. Patients usually

42	experience pain and may exhibit anterior apprehension, subluxation/instability and

43	pseudoparalysis 6, 13.

44	Loss of active shoulder internal rotation can also be seen in patients who undergo reverse

45	shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). In this setting though patients experience significant

46	improvement of shoulder motion, gains in shoulder internal rotation can be very

47	unpredictable1, 15, 23. It has been shown that repair of the subscapularis may improve

48	postoperative internal rotation, especially if the repair is proven to be healed5; however,

49	outcomes are not consistent10,11,16.
 
50	Several tendon transfers have been described for the management of an irreparable

51	subscapularis tear. The most common transfers reported are the pectoralis minor4,20or the

52	pectoralis major26. Several studies have shown satisfactory long-term results after transfer of

53	the sternal head of the pectoralis major tendon.9, 17, 19, 22  However, other reports have shown

54	poor outcomes of this transfer, especially in patients with concurrent anterior instability8, 19.

55	Poor outcomes with the pectoralis major transfer may be due to the fact that the line of pull of

56	the pectoralis major does not replicate that of the subscapularis. An ideal tendon transfer

57	should adhere to five basic biomechanical principles: theprooftransferredmuscle must have a


58	similar (i) line of pull, (ii) tension and (iii) excursion to that  f the muscle replaced; (iv) one

59	transfer should be used to replace only one deficient function; (v) the donor muscle must have

60	normal strength. When evaluating the location and line    pull of the pectoralis major

61	compared to the subscapularis, the sternal head of the pectoralis major originates from the

62	anterior chest wall, whereas the subscapu aris originates from the anterior scapular body,

63	which is positioned on the posterior	spect of the chest wall (Fig. 1). In 2014, Elhassan et al

64	described the feasibility of t ansfe ring muscle posterior to the chest wall (teres major or

65	latissimus dorsi) anteri  rly to replicate the line of pull of the subscapularis muscle7. To our

66	knowledge, no study has evaluated the outcome of tendon transfers to restore internal rotation

67	after RSA. Also, though an anatomic study has been done to prove the feasibility of transfer

68	of the latissimus and/or teres major to reconstruct an irreparable subscapularis, no prior

69	biomechanical study has evaluated the effectiveness of these transfers or the pectoralis

70	transfer to restore shoulder internal rotation to the native shoulder with a deficient anterior

71	rotator cuff tear or in shoulder with RSA.

72	The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the internal rotation moment arm

73	(IRMA) of different types of tendon transfers to restore shoulder internal rotation with and

74	without RSA.

78	Six fresh frozen right hemithorax/shoulder girdle cadaveric specimens (4 men, 2 women)

79	were used for this study. The mean age of the specimens at the time of death was 86 years old

80	(± 7.71). Fluoroscopic imaging was used to assess each shoulder to rule out radiographic

81	signs of glenohumeral arthritis. Following dissection, the articular surfaces, capsular tissues,

82	and rotator cuff musculature were examined.  Gross evidenceprooffullthickness cartilage loss,



83	visible rotator cuff tears or evidence of prior surgery mate ial  esulted in elimination of the

84	specimen.

85	Cadaveric specimens were prepared following the protocol previously described by Hartzler

86	et al.12 The upper extremities were prepared by cutting the arm at the mid-humerus below the

87	deltoid insertion. A fiberglass intramedu  ary rod was placed into the remaining humeral shaft

88	and secured with cross pins. Cad veric he ds were removed at a level to preserve the cervical

89	vertebrae and the origin of the	pper trapezius muscle.  Solid organs were removed from the

90	chest and abdominal cavities. Musculature originating or inserting from the spine, pelvis,

91	sternum, ribcage, thorax, back, and shoulder girdle were otherwise preserved.

92	Skin and subcutaneous tissues were removed to allow direct visualization of the underlying

93	shoulder and periscapular musculature. Each specimen was secured to the custom positioner

94	used in our previous publication12. The specimens native lordotic and kyphotic curvatures

95	were preserved during fixation of the spinal column to the custom positioner.

96	The Polhemus Fastrak (Colchester, VT, USA) 3-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic tracking

97	system was used to capture raw kinematic data. This system utilizes sensors which can be

98	fixed to a cadaveric specimen.  These sensors are tracked by a small electromagnetic field for

99	changes in position and orientation with 6° of free dom. Sensors were fixed to the scapula,
 
100	humerus, and thorax.  A coordinate system was then established according to International

101	Society of Biomechanics according to the recommendations for each bone. Euler angles were

102	measured to determine glenohumeral joint angles. The humeral coordinate system was

103	modified as previously described, using the ends of the cross-pin placed perpendicular to the

104	bicipital groove to recreate the epicondylar axis distally on the intramedullary rod.

105	Tendon and joint displacement (TJD) measurements were used to calculate the moment arm

106	(MA). Arnold ref

107	The humeral rod was controlled using a guide which allowedproofrtheexecution of precise


108	passive translations and rotations in all planes. One surgeon manipulated each humerus

109	specimen for all TJD experiments (JDW).

110	Reverse shoulder arthroplasty

111	For the RSA configuration testing, a reverse shoulder prosthesis (Comprehensive, Zimmer-

112	Biomet, Warsaw,JournalIN,USA)wasimpanted by an experienced surgeon through a deltopectoral


113	approach. Tenotomy of the subsc pul ris was performed. The humerus was cut in 20°

114	retroversion at the anatomic neck. A 36mm glenosphere was used in female cadavers and a 40

115	mm glenopshere used f   male cadavers. This system has 5.2 mm of built in lateralization

116	with use of the standard glenopsheres. The smallest polyethlene tray was used on the humeral

117	side 25. The subscapularis was not repaired at the end of the procedure to simulate a

118	subscapularis deficiency.

119	Modeling of the tendon transfers

120	All tendon transfers for this study were modeled to replicate the options available in clinical

121	practice. Transferred muscles included: the Sternal Head of the Pectoralis Major (PM),

122	Latissimus Dorsi (LD), and Teres Major (TM).  These muscles were modeled to insert into 3

123	selected locations:
 

-	Supraspinatus (SSP): anterior part of the insertion site of the supraspinatus tendon on the greater tuberosity


- Subscapularis (SSC): insertion site of the subscapularis on the lesser tuberosity Therefore, 5 tendon-transfer pairs were modeled: PM-SSC, LD-SSP, LD-SSC, TM-SSP, TM-SSC.

Tendon transfers were modeled by placing non-absorbable braided #5 sutures along the line of action of the transferred muscles from its origin to insertion (Fig. 2). Each suture was centered at the muscle origin midpoint as measured by the curvilinear distance of each muscle’s bony origin. The midpoint of the origin was ma ked and a drill hole/eye screw placed to allow passage of a cord. The PM, LD, and TM muscle tissue was then removed to allow the cord to track over the underlyingPrestructussimilar to the native muscle. The cord construct used to evaluate the PM transfer was passed under the conjoined tendon when tested

on the intact shoulderJournalandabovetheconjoined tendon when tested with a RSA because of the risk of insufficient space for proper gliding of the transferred pectoralis major in a reverse
setting.

IRMA Determinati

TJD experiments were performed on all specimen to model every tendon transfer variation. Joint displacement and tendon excursion were assessed throughout the arc of axial humeral rotation with the humerus at 0° of abduction for ea ch tendon transfer. The humerus was then repositioned to 90° of abduction in the plane of th e scapula. Tendon excursion and joint displacements were again assessed through an arc of axial humeral rotation. Experimental conditions were performed in triplicate to allow for conditioning of the residual soft tissues. The average moment arm from each of the three trials was utilized for statistical analysis.
 

IRMAs were computed based on the observed joint and tendon displacement. Tendon excursion is a function of both moment arm and joint rotation. The instantaneous moment arm (r) is related to tendon excursion (E) as well as joint rotation (θ) (r = dE/dθ).

Axial rotation of the humerus was computed with Euler angles, which were captured from the experimental sensors. Custom electropotentiometers were used to measure tendon excursion. Both tendon excursion and joint displacement measurements were captured using Motion Monitor Software. These data points were plotted to fit a polynomial function using Matlab
software (Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA, USA), with a requirementproofthatthe root-mean-square
error be < 0.5mm. The instantaneous IRMA for a specified a c r tati n of the humerus was computed at every 1°.



Tendon transfer IRMAs were compared using a two-way repeated-value analysis of variance. Means and standard deviations of the IRMAs of the tendon pairs are reported with the arm at the side and with the arm abducted t 90°. A 2-way repeated measures ANOVA model was used to compare tendon transfe s, position of the arm and IRMA. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).


Results (Table 1)

Native Shoulder

Tendon transfers were shown to have a significant effect on IRMA (p < 0.001). With the
 

168	humerus adducted (Fig .3), the IRMA of the TM-SSP (14.1 mm ± 3.1 mm)

169	was significantly greater than the IRMA of the LD-SSP (7.3 mm ± 1.2 mm; p < 0.001) or

170	PM-SSC (7.1 mm ± 0.9 mm; p < 0.001). With the humerus abducted to 90° (Fig. 4), the

171	IRMAs of the LD- SSP (30.0 mm ± 5.4 mm) and TM-SSP (28.4 mm ± 6.6 mm) were
 
172	significantly greater than the IRMA of the LD-SSC (10.3 mm ± 2.4 mm; p =0.03, p =0.007 )

173	or TM-SSC (8.2 mm ± 1.1 mm; p = 0.001, p =0.04) or PM-SSC (5.5 mm ± 1.2 mm; p <

174	0.001, p < 0.001).

175	The effect of transferred tendons was significantly affected by the position of the humerus (P

176	< .0001). With the shoulder at 90° of abduction, the IRMA of the LD-SSP (30.0 mm ± 10.1

177	mm) and TM-SSP (28.4 mm ± 7 mm) were significantly greater than the IRMA with the

178	humerus adducted to 0° (LD-SSP: 7.3 mm ± 1.4 mm, P= 0.004; TM-SSP : 14.1 mm ± 2.9

179	mm, P= 0.03). However, the IRMAs of the PM, LD-SSC and TM-SSC remained relatively

180	unaffected by the position of the humerus in abduction-adducti  n.

181	Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty

182	When tendon transfers were performed in conjunction with RSA, tendon transfers also

183	significantly affected the evaluated IRMA (P < .0001). With the humerus adducted to the side

184	(Fig .5), the IRMA of the PM-SSC (19.9 mm ± 6.4 mm) was significantly greater than the

185	IRMA of the TM-SSC (4.7 mm ± 0.9 mm; p < 0.001) or LD-SSP (2.9 mm± 0.5 mm; p <

186	0.001). With the humer  s abd  cted to 90° (Fig. 6), the IRMAs of the LD- SSP (31.8 mm ±

187	11.2 mm), TM-SSP (26.2 mm ± 7.8 mm) and PM-SSC (22 mm ± 7.4 mm) were not

188	significantly different. However, the IRMAs of the TM and LD transfers were significantly

189	smaller when transferred to the SSC than to the SSP (14.4 mm ± 5.7 mm versus 26.2 mm ±

190	5.8 mm, p=0.05 and 7.7 mm ± 2.7 mm versus 31.8 mm ± 10.1 mm, p=0.043 respectively).

191	The IRMA of the native shoulder differed significantly from that of the RSA state for all

192	tendon transfers (P < .0001). With the humerus adducted to the side of the body (Fig. 7), the

193	IRMA of the RSA PM-SSC transfer was significantly greater than without an RSA (P <

194	.0001), demonstrating increased efficiency for internal rotation in the RSA state.  In contrast,

195	the IRMA of the TM-SSP was more advantageous in the native shoulder, with a significantly

196	greater IRMA compared to the same tendon transfer after implantation with a RSA (P <
 
197	.0001). The IRMA of the LD-SSP remained relatively unchanged before and after RSA

198	(P=0.09). With the shoulder abducted to 90° (Fig. 8 ), the IRMA of the PM-SSC with a RSA

199	was significantly greater compared to a native shoulder (P < .0001) whereas the IRMA of the
 



LD-SSP and the TM-SSP were similar in both conditions (P=0.12 and P=0.09 respectively).




Discussion

This biomechanical study shows that in a native shoulder, transfer of the teres major and of the latissimus dorsi proximally to the anterior footprint proofthesupraspinatus (SSP) could efficiently restore active internal rotation, especially when the a m is abducted. In this position, the line of pull of the latissimus dorsi is directly e endicular to the axis of rotation of the humerus. Internal rotation with the arm abduct d is crucial to placing the arm behind
the back which is necessary for personal hygiene15, 24.

The feasibility of transferringJournaltheteresmajor and latissimus dorsi has been evaluated in a cadaveric study . Further work by Elh sssan et al showed that the latissimus dorsi can be

transferred anteriorly witho t isking impingement of the axillary or radial nerve. However, transfer of the teres maj may possibly lead to compression of the axillary nerve within the quadrangular space. Therefore, the safest and most effective option to restore the internal rotation motion 7arm after an irreparable tear of the subscapularis is the transfer of the latissimus dorsi proximally on the humeral head at the level of the anterior footprint of the

supraspinatus. This is supported by recent clinical studies14, 18 showing a statistically significant improvement in internal rotation from L5 to L1 in 29 patients after transfer of the latissimus dorsi anteriorly to the proximal portion of the lesser tuberosity.

Long term follow-up studies on transfer of the sternal head of the pectoralis major below the conjoined tendon for irreparable tear of the subscapularis have reported satisfactory long-term
results.9, 17 In these studies, the indication for surgery was pain and loss of motion. At a mean
 

follow-up (19.7 years, 10 years respectively), the authors of both studies showed significant improvement in pain and range of motion (including internal rotation) after pectoralis major transfer. However, it is important to note that none of the patients complained of anterior instability prior to transfer. Unsatisfactory results after transfer of the pectoralis tendon have

been reported when patients have concurrent anterior instability or subluxation 8, 19.

Our biomechanical study shows that the IRMA of the pectoralis major transfer is inferior to that of the teres major with the arm on the side and both the teres major and latissimus dorsi with the arm at 90° of abduction when tested in the native shoulder. This is due to the fact that

the native shoulder is an unconstrained joint and transfe ing the pect ralis major causes the head to translate anteriorly rather than purely internally otate. The pectoralis major transfer is

able to restore internal rotation when the arm is plac d in maximum external rotation, but as soon as the arm moves to neutral rotation, the t ansfer is no longer efficient. Anterior

translation may beJournalaccentuatedinpatients with concurrent loss of the anterior labrum and deficient glenohumeral ligame ts. In p tients without prior instability or subluxation, the
native tissues may contin e to p ovide resistance to instability and allow the pectoralis tendon to provide an anteri c mpressive force to counter balance the intact posterior rotator cuff. With loss of the anterior labrum, transfer of the pectoralis tendon may cause anterior subluxation an destabilize the centered compressive force to the glenohumeral joint. Therefore, in younger patients with a history of shoulder instability and an irreparable subscapularis, a latissimus dorsi transfer may be the preferred transfer to restore a posteriorly directed line of pull to avoid an anteriorly directed transfer force. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of the anterior labrum in the setting of tendon transfers for irreparable anterior rotator cuff tears.

However, the biomechanics of this transfer do change after RSA. The RSA is a semi-constrained prosthesis and the humeral head does not translate anteriorly. Instead, all applied
 
247	forces are converted into rotational forces. Thus, the transfer of the sternal head of the

248	pectoralis major becomes an efficient transfer to restore internal rotation. Several hypotheses

249	have been proposed to explain the loss of internal rotation after RSA.  These include rotator

250	cuff deficiency, alteration of the rotator cuff moment arm, poor scapulothoracic control and

251	mechanical impingement.  Of these, the most commonly accepted explanation is that

252	excessive medialization creates mechanical impingement between the scapular pillar and the

253	humerus and decreases tension of the residual rotator cuff 3. This mechanical impingement
254	has been confirmed by Rol et al21 as they have proven proofthatpostperative internal rotation


255	above L3 was significantly associated with a greater glenosphe e  verhang. In the Rol el at

256	series21 with no glenoid lateralization (which could  ossibly dec ease impingement between

257	the humerus and scapular pillar) neither the condition    the subscapularis nor subscapularis

258	repair were significantly associated with imp oved internal rotation. However, Collin et al5
259	showed that internalJournalrotationinpatientswith a healed subscapularis tendon was significantly

260	higher than in the patients with   ruptured repair after RSA with a lateralized glenosphere

261	configuration. Therefore, t ansfer of the pectoralis major tendon may be an option to restore

262	active internal rotati   in c  mbination with a lateralized glenosphere RSA when the

263	subscapularis is irreparable. This transfer can easily be performed through a delto-pectoral

264	approach by detaching the insertion from the lateral border of the bicipital groove and

265	transferring it to the lesser tuberosity. Clinical studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

266	This biomechanical study is limited by several factors. First, IRMA’s were determined only

267	for glenohumeral internal rotation. Clinically, internal rotation is the results of combined

268	motions of both the glenohumeral joint as well as the scapulothoracic articulation. Based on

269	this model, we are unable to assess the effect of these tendon transfers when the scapula is not

270	a fixed structure. Second, the IRMA was only calculated for the transferred tendon.  This did

271	not take into account the volume of muscle generating the force, which can affect the IRMA.
 
272	Additionally, this study was limited to a small number of cadaveric specimens, which may

273	have affected the results. Due to these limitations, the number of variables evaluated in our

274	statistical model was limited to comparing tendon transfer pairs that were deemed to be

275	clinically relevant. Third, the transferred muscles each have broad origins. The simplification

276	of reproducing the line of pull from the center of the muscular origin may not replicate the in-

277	vivo function of these tendon transfers.  However, we felt this was necessary to simplify the

278	comparisons maintain clinically meaningful results. Lastly, the effects of surgical technique,

279	tendon mobilization, length-tension relationships, and glenohumeral stability were not

280	addressed with this model.  Even with these limitations, the	bserved differences between

281	transfers were great enough to achieve statistical significance using a modeling strategy which

282	accounted for repeated measures. This study should s rve as a foundation for future

283	biomechanical studies on the effect of tendon t ansfer to restore internal rotation to the

284	glenohumeral joint.

285

286	Conclusion

287	Tendon transfers to rest  re sho  lder internal rotation differ in effectiveness and may be

288	affected by arm position and by implantation of RSA. LD potentially results in superior

289	restoration of shoulder internal rotation in a native shoulder (given the risk of nerve

290	compression with the TM transfer) compared to PM and should be considered as a potential

291	tendon transfer to restore internal rotation in selected patients. In combination with a RSA, the

292	fulcrum provided by the biomechanics of the semi-constrained implant allows the PM transfer

293	to become more efficient tendon transfer to restore active internal rotation.

Background: Paralleling the increased utilization of shoulder arthroplasty, bundled-payment reimbursement is becoming increasingly common. An understanding of the costs of each element of care and detailed information on the frequency of and reasons for read-mission and reoperation are keys to developing bundled-payment initiatives. The purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive analysis of complications, readmission rates, and costs of primary shoulder arthroplasty at a high-volume institution.

Methods: Between 2012 and 2016, 2 shoulder surgeons from a single institution performed 1794 consecutive primary shoulder arthro-plasties: 636 anatomic total shoulder arthroplasties (TSAs), 1081 reverse shoulder arthroplasties (RSAs), and 77 hemiarthroplasties. A cost analysis was designed to include a period of 60 days preoperatively, the index surgical hospitalization, and 90 days postoperatively, including costs of any readmission or reoperation.

Results: The 90-day complication, reoperation, and readmission rates were 2.3%, 0.6%, and 1.8%, respectively. The 90-day readmis-sion risk was higher among patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3 or greater; a 1-unit increase in the Amer-ican Society of Anesthesiologists score was associated with a $429 increase in index cost. Of the hospital readmissions, 10 were directly related to the index arthroplasty whereas 21 were not. The median standardized costs were as follows: preoperative evaluation, $481; index surgical hospitalization, $15,758; and postoperative care, $183. The median standardized costs for index surgical hospi-talization were different for each procedure: TSA, $14,010; RSA, $16,741; and hemiarthroplasty, $12,709.

Conclusion: In this study, primary shoulder arthroplasty was associated with low 90-day reoperation and complication rates. The me-dian standardized costs inclusive of preoperative workup and 90-day postoperative recovery were $14,675 and ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127552771/224484251-e5ebfd61-c70b-4859-bbab-b6824248d151.png)

National trends have witnessed a substantial increase in shoulder arthroplasty in the United States over the past 2 decades. Previous studies have shown an overall increase in the number of total shoulder arthroplasties (TSAs) per-formed in the United States between 2002 and 2011.6,9,21 Owing to our aging population, recent literature has pro-jected that shoulder arthroplasty will increase by 755% in patients older than 55 years by 2030.14 The introduction as![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127552771/224484262-6f6f9f4a-0b9a-485e-a3a1-61a5d72eb832.png)
well as widespread use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) has played a major role in the acceleration in the number of shoulder arthroplasties, with roughly 10,000 RSAs performed in the United States in 2007, a 5-fold increase over 2004.7 The economic burden associated with the increasing volume of shoulder arthroplasty is becoming a focus for health care systems in an attempt to better understand costs and to develop value-based reim-bursement models.

Paralleling the increased utilization of shoulder arthro-plasty, bundled-payment reimbursement initiatives are becoming more popular in this particular field. The bundled-payment initiative was formally introduced in 2010 with Accountable Care Organizations under the Medicare Shared Savings Program as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.15 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services aimed to link payments for multiple provider services within a single episode of care and formulate a single bundled fee to be paid out to a single facility and subsequently divvied out to individual pro-

viders or entities.	The premise is that health care de-

livery efficiency and cost containment for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will be driven by the health care team when the single entity is provided a single lump reimbursement with which to deliver health care services. Hospitals and providers would be incentivized by respon-sible resource allocation and the provision of cost-effective

services to patients.	Although not yet widely imple-

mented in shoulder arthroplasty, the bundled-payment initiative in knee and hip arthroplasty creates the need for a similar value analysis in shoulder arthroplasty, which will certainly become an area of further interest from govern-ment and private payers.

A central component of risk-based reimbursement is a clear understanding of the costs of each element of care as well as detailed information on the frequency of, reasons for, and costs of readmission and reoperation. Two recently published meta-analyses investigated early readmission within 90 days of the index shoulder procedure: Mahoney et al11 reported 90-day readmission rates of 4.5%, 8.8%, and 6.6% for anatomic TSA, hemiarthroplasty (HA), and RSA, respectively, with surgical-site infection being the leading surgical cause. Schairer et al16 reviewed a large series of arthroplasties and reported similar rates of 6%, 8.2%, and 11.2% for TSA, HA, and RSA, respectively, with surgical-site infection and dislocation being the leading causes of surgical readmission but accounting for only 18% of readmissions because 82% of readmissions were related to medical comorbidities.

The economic impact of providing cost-efficient and sustainable care for patients has become a major focus for health care systems, warranting thorough investigative ef-forts. A review of the literature reveals that high-quality

information in these areas is lacking. Virani et al published preliminary work evaluating early experiences
with a limited number of TSA and RSA patients and costs followed prospectively, but there is a paucity of further quality economic analysis of shoulder arthroplasty. Kuye et al10 recently published a report reviewing current liter-ature performing an economic evaluation of shoulder pa-thologies; this study suggested a recent significant increase in the interest around economic feasibility studies in the shoulder arena, but there is a clear demand for more rigorous economic evaluation. More recently, Menendez et al13 have applied a time-driven cost-analysis methodol-ogy to shoulder arthroplasty.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a 5-year comprehensive and detailed analysis of 90-day com-plications, readmission rates, and costs of primary shoulder arthroplasty at a high-volume institution. We recognize that the nuances of the institution and the preoperative and postoperative protocols examined here will not serve as a standard for all facilities; accordingly, we recommend that this research not be used as a benchmark for the legislature. Instead, we detail the predictors of increased cost during the perioperative period from a high-volume center with very experienced surgeons, which should be viewed as a goal for other centers and should not serve as a benchmark for policy makers.
Materials and methods

Our institutional joint registry database was used to identify all primary TSAs performed by 2 fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons between 2012 and 2016 at a single institution. A total of 1904 consecutive primary shoulder arthroplasties had been performed during the study period. To avoid confusion between preoperative and postoperative services for patients receiving arthroplasties on both shoulders within a short period, the second case of every pair (n ¼ 103) performed within 1 year was removed from analysis. We excluded 7 additional shoulders from the study because of confounding factors that might arti-ficially increase the cost of conventional arthroplasty such as malignancy or concomitant procedures performed in the same setting as shoulder arthroplasty. After also excluding patients who refused to sign Minnesota Research Authorization forms, we analyzed a final sample of 1794 consecutive primary TSA cases corresponding to 1707 patients: 636 TSAs, 1081 RSAs, and 77 HAs. Patient demographic characteristics are detailed in Table I.

A standardized cost analysis for this study was designed to include a period of 60 days preoperatively, the index surgical hospitalization, and 90 days postoperatively. The period of 60 days prior to surgery was selected because the 2 surgeons participating in this study routinely provide a consultation, refer patients for medical clearance for anesthesia and surgery, and obtain new radiographs and a computed tomography scan of the shoulder to be replaced all within the 2 months preceding surgery. All index surgical hospitalization services from admission through discharge were included in the analysis. Types of index services were categorized by uniform billing revenue codes; Current Pro-cedural Terminology, fourth edition (CPT4), procedure codes; and

internal charge master codes. The diagnosis and CPT4 procedure codes for all services during the preoperative and postoperative periods were examined to determine whether they were related to the arthroplasties.

As mentioned earlier, the most frequently provided preopera-tive period services included preoperative medical evaluation and testing, orthopedic consultation, standard shoulder radiographs, and computed tomography with 3-dimensional reconstruction for surgical planning. The specific services are displayed by CPT4 code in Table II. In addition, over 40% of the patients received an echocardiogram or some other form of cardiovascular testing.

The 90-day postoperative period typically entailed 1 or 2 follow-up evaluations in the clinic, a single 3-view shoulder radiograph session, and physical therapy (PT). Because a sub-stantial portion of the patients included in this study needed to travel more than 6 hours to return for a follow-up evaluation, many patients chose not to return at all but rather sought follow-up care by a local provider or were followed up through telemedicine (electronic review of radiographs and communication through phone calls or e-mails). Any concerns regarding complications or patient questions were addressed directly with the surgical team

and documented in the electronic medical record. Standardized costs reported in this study only included services provided by our health system; no modeling was performed to capture the cost of missing services.

Inpatient services and emergency department encounters were further subjected to detailed review of the electronic medical re-cord by us. Some of the complications identified after shoulder arthroplasty occurred before discharge from the index surgical hospitalization; they are therefore included in index, rather than postoperative, costs.

Standardized cost methodology

Standardized costs were obtained from our institutional cost data warehouse, which uses widely accepted health service research methodology. Medicare reimbursement was assigned to all professional billed services, the appropriate Medicare Cost Report cost-to-charge ratios were multiplied by the charges for all hospital billed services, and all resulting costs were adjusted to 2016 dollars with the gross domestic product implicit price deflator.19

Ninety-day complications, readmissions, and sta-tistical analysis

Complications and readmissions were analyzed as time-to-event outcomes using survivorship methodology. Specifically, rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and are reported with 95% confidence intervals. The associations between these out-comes and sex, body mass index, and American Society of An-esthesiologists (ASA) score were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Although a broad set of descriptive statistics for cost variables including median, mean, and standard deviation are provided, given that health care cost data are generally skewed, the median cost will be emphasized. To adjust for potential confounders, we also conducted a generalized linear modeling regression with gamma distribution for cost and logarithmic link, which was then used to assess the average marginal effect of different predictors on the average index costs. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

The median age (interquartile range [IQR]) at the time of primary shoulder arthroplasty cases for the 1707 patients (1794 arthroplasties) included in the study was 70 years (IQR, 63-77 years). Fewer than one-third of the cases (30.5%) corresponded to local patients residing in the sur-rounding counties at the time of surgery, and even many of the local patients received some care outside our hospital system. Only 12 of 1794 cases (0.67%) were missing pre-operative workup costs, whereas 289 of 1794 (16.1%) had no 90-day postoperative costs captured.

The 90-day complication, reoperation, and readmission rates were 2.3%, 0.6%, and 1.8%, respectively. Of the hospital readmissions within 90 days, 68% were not related
were related to other reasons (cardiopulmonary events, accidental falls, metabolic disturbances, and so on).

The median standardized costs for our cohort were as follows: preoperative evaluation, $481; index surgical hospitalization, $15,758; and postoperative care, $183 (Table III). Preoperative and postoperative costs did not vary significantly based on the type of arthroplasty per-formed. However, the index surgical hospitalization median standardized costs were affected by the procedure type: TSA, $14,010; RSA, $16,741; and HA, $12,709 (Table IV).

All but 7 shoulders received some form of PT during the index surgical hospitalization and/or postoperative period. The average protocol comprised 1 PT evaluation plus 4 PT treatment sessions, as in our practice most of the therapy is initially taught to the patient and then performed at home by the patient without formal visits with a physical thera-pist. The median standardized cost of PT was $422 (IQR, $330-$537), with a median percentage of total cost taking place during the index stay of 68.9%.

The highest standardized cost for the index hospitali-zation was related to the cost of the implant (mean, 25.2%), followed by the operating room facility (24.6%), surgeon (12.6%), and hospital room (12.0%) costs (Table V). Implant cost varied by type of surgery, with the RSA pro-cedure implant being the most expensive (Table VI). On average, the RSA implant also comprised a higher per-centage of the total index hospitalization cost, at 28.1% (vs. 21.8% for TSA and 19.2% for HA).

Hospital room cost and length of stay were driven by discharge disposition. The median and mean lengths of stay for the 88.8% of patients discharged home were 1 and 1.2 days, respectively, whereas patients who were not dis-charged home remained in the hospital for a median of 3 days and mean of 3.3 days.

In the 90-day postoperative period, there were a total of 40 complications, 10 reoperations, and 37 readmissions in 31 patients. The 90-day event rates for complications, reoperations, and readmissions were 2.34%, 0.63%, and 1.82%, respectively (Table VII). These resulted in a very low mean readmission cost of $244 (median, $0). When we considered only those shoulders that had an associated readmission, the median readmission standardized cost per case was $11,031 (IQR, $5948-$16,741). These read-mission costs averaged 81% of their index costs, ranging from 20.5% to 247%.

There was no significant difference in complication, reoperation, or readmission rates regarding sex or body mass index ( 30 vs. <30). The risk of readmission within 90 days was higher among patients with an ASA score of 3 or higher than in patients with an ASA score of 2 or less (hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.3; P ¼ .03). Of the
to the shoulder arthroplasty whereas 21 (68%) were not directly related to the procedure or prosthesis. Shoulder- and implant-related causes of readmission included dislocation (n ¼ 4), periprosthetic joint infection (n ¼ 2), hematoma (n ¼ 2), periprosthetic fracture requiring reoperation (n ¼ 1), and implant loosening (n ¼ 1). Non–shoulder-related entities such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cerebrovascular accident, cardiopulmonary compromise, and metabolic imbalance accounted for 21 other readmissions.

Using generalized linear modeling of index cost, we found ASA score, age at surgery, surgical type, and discharge status to be statistically significant. Specifically, the marginal effect of the ASA score was $429, implying that a 1-unit increase in the ASA score was associated with
a $429 increase in index cost. Similarly, the marginal effect of age at index surgery was –$16, indicating a decrease of $16 in index cost with an increase in the patient’s age by an additional year. Compared with HA, RSA and TSA were associated with $4230 and $1501 higher index costs, respectively. Patients who were discharged home rather than a skilled nursing facility had on average a $3647 lower index cost (Table VIII).![image]
By the year 2030, the demand for shoulder arthroplasties is projected to increase by 333.3% for patients 55 years or younger and by 755.4% for patients older than 55 years.14 Increasing demand coupled with rising health care costs carries substantial planning implications for both the health care system at large and the medical education community in addressing the need for qualified shoulder specialists to meet this demand. Moreover, as cost containment and bundled payments become an increasingly common focus for health care systems, payers, and surgeons, the key to sound decision making is quality health care economics research. Previous studies by Gartsman et al8 and Virani et al17,18 have provided clear evidence of the positive impact of shoulder arthroplasty on pain reduction and functionality improvement. The goal remains to provide!
value with a balanced interest in both high-quality patient care and fiscal accountability.

Our study observed low 90-day complication, reoper-ation, and readmission rates (2.3%, 0.6%, and 1.8%, respectively) when shoulder arthroplasty was performed by 1 of 2 high-volume shoulder surgeons with a standardized perioperative care plan. Although there is interest in performing outpatient shoulder arthroplasty in select patients, at this point this is not part of our practice. Our patients routinely stay in the hospital ward for 1 night, with the vast majority leaving on postoperative day 1 and 88% being discharged home or to a local hotel prior
to travel; 12% of our patients are discharged to a skilled nursing facility. Previous studies have reported 90-day readmission rates of 4.5% to 8.8% and 6% to 11.2%.11,16 Schairer et al16 reviewed 8180 shoulder arthroplasties and attributed 82% of readmissions to medical complications. Matsen et al12 reported 90-day read-mission rates of 2.5% for TSAs and 3.2% for HAs. Our readmission rate of 1.8% is slightly lower than the rates in the aforementioned studies; similarly to previous litera-ture, 68% of 90-day readmissions in our study were attributed to medical complications. It is interesting to note that only 2 of 1794 cases in our study (0.11%) were readmitted for a periprosthetic infection within 90 days. Of note, delayed infection presentation, after 90 days, was not captured in this study.

Our 90-day complication rate of 2.3% is on par with, although at the low end of, previously reported ranges be-tween 3% and 11%.2,3,5,17,18,20 The majority of complica-tions identified in this study were medically related and consistent with common reasons previously reported by other studies; the most frequent complications were respi-ratory, renal, and cardiac in nature.1

Current literature reflects an interest in cost analysis within orthopedics, but the methods have varied substan-tially in the calculation and reporting of cost. Chalmers et al4 recently performed an analysis investigating the direct costs of shoulder arthroplasty, although their cohort was smaller and more heterogeneous. Preoperative and postoperative costs were also excluded in their study, as the primary focus was purely on the index procedure; similarly, readmissions and subsequent readmission cost impact were not analyzed in their study.4 Virani et al17,18 published similar analyses prospectively evaluating smaller cohorts of patients (N ¼ 83 and N ¼ 55) and following direct costs within their local health care system. In our study, costs that accrued in the hospital system were provided for each pa-tient as direct allocated costs, which included the cost of materials, personnel, resource utilization, rent, and other necessary factors; costs that accrued outside the hospital system were defined for each patient by the year-specific
regional Medicare reimbursement during the study period.17

Our study design produced a large cohort of patients and provides a combination of standardized costs, a previously validated cost analysis model used for hip and knee arthroplasty, and resource allocation as percentages of direct costs for the perioperative period to include 60 days preoperatively, index hospitalization, and 90 days post-operatively. With implant cost accounting for a quarter of the index hospitalization and with facility costs accounting for another quarter, half of the total cost of index hospi-talization is captured by these 2 elements. Notably, the implant costs of RSA represented a higher proportion (28.1%) of index costs compared with TSA (21.8%) or HA

(19.2%). Currently, reimbursement for TSA and RSA is identical under most payer systems owing to Current Pro-cedural Terminology coding, despite the higher cost incurred when performing an RSA procedure; this repre-sents an area that deserves future consideration.

Perioperative factors also had a large impact on costs for some of the patients included in this study. Discharge disposition carries a significant impact on the cost of care. Of our patients, 88% were discharged home, with a median hospital stay of 1 day, whereas the remaining 12% were discharged to a skilled nursing facility or rehabilitation facility after a median stay of 3 days. We believe this finding is likely partially attributed to the mandated 3-night inpatient rule for Medicare reim-bursement for these step-down care facilities. Many of these patients would be able to leave earlier than the 3-night average if not for the reimbursement issue just mentioned. Similarly, postoperative readmissions signif-icantly impacted cost and should continue to be an area of focus for providers to minimize. In our cohort, only 1.8% of patients required readmission within 90 days, but among the associated readmissions, the readmission costs averaged 81% of the index cost, with 1 instance reaching nearly 250% of the index cost. As bundled-payment discussions progress, the focus on minimizing readmissions will remain critical.
A number of limitations exist in our study, including its retrospective, single-center, nonrandomized nature. The efficiency and high-volume nature of the practice of the 2 senior authors is not generalizable to low-volume practices and hospitals. The senior authors perform 400-500 primary and complex revision shoulder arthroplasties annually with standardized perioperative protocols and almost 40 years of combined shoulder reconstruction experience. A significant number of patients in this practicedas a quaternary referral centerdare first evaluated by an outside provider and referred for a single consultation visit prior to surgery. Similarly, many of our patients receive postoperative 90-day care by their referring provider or through telemedi-cine. Most of our patients are instructed on a home PT regimen during a single inpatient therapy session prior to dismissal on postoperative day 1. Similarly, many patients receive 4 outpatient PT sessions as instruction for a home therapy program as progressive motion and strengthening commence at 3-6 weeks postoperatively. The remainder of the postoperative therapy is home based. As such, the 90-day postoperative period typically entailed 1 clinic visit, a limited number of PT sessions, and a single 3-view shoulder radiograph session. This postoperative protocol with minimal formal PT likely serves as a change of practice for lower-volume centers and must be considered a limitation in broadly applying these metrics to all in-stitutions. The shoulder surgeons in this study routinely see their arthroplasty patients at 1-2 visits within 90 days. Because a significant number of the patients in this cohort travel from more than 6 hours away, many patients chose not to return at all but rather sought follow-up care by a local provider. Patients have 1 set of radiographs obtained within 90 days; radiographs are often mailed to the primary surgeon and reviewed remotely for abnormalities. Local wound care and postoperative visits are often handled by a local provider rather than by the primary surgeon. Any concerns regarding complications or patient questions are addressed directly with the surgeon and team and docu-mented in the electronic medical record. These practice nuances may lower preoperative and postoperative costs in this study.

Another limitation of our study, as with most cost studies, is an imperfect economic analysis tool; standard-ized costs are useful for understanding cost components but are not easily translated to a particular provider’s or payer’s costs. Certain preoperative and postoperative costs may not be captured by services incurred at other facilities; how-ever, our large cohort and resource allocation metrics aim to offset these potential limitations. Moreover, despite standardized costs reported in this study, the direct medical costs reported in this study are not directly applicable to bundled-payment formulation by Accountable Care Orga-nizations. With patients with ASA grade 3 or 4 having a statistically significantly higher rate of 90-day readmission in our study, payers should consider risk adjustment for these patients, which would cover not only a higher
likelihood of complications but also the likely additional preoperative testing such as echocardiograms and other advanced studies. Medically complicated patients will continue to be best treated in the inpatient setting, whereas providers may elect to perform shoulder arthroplasty as an outpatient procedure in healthy patients at an ambulatory surgery center. The potential cost impact of increased risk in more unhealthy patients will need to be considered in future bundled-payment discussions.

Conclusion
In a health care system with standardized preoperative and postoperative protocols and high-volume shoulder surgeons, primary shoulder arthroplasty yielded low 90-day reoperation and readmission rates of 0.6% and 1.8%, respectively. The 90-day complication rate was

2.3%; the majority of these complications were attrib-utable to medically related complications rather than shoulder-related complications. The median standard-ized costs for primary shoulder arthroplasty inclusive of the 60-day preoperative workup and 90-day post-operative recovery were $14,675 and $17,407 for TSA and RSA, respectively. This retrospective cost analysis and complication profile serve as preliminary informa-tion in achieving the overarching goal of decreasing the economic burden of this procedure while providing high-quality outcomes for patients. This study may further serve as a useful reference for surgeons as they consider shoulder arthroplasty bundled-payment models. A multicenter cost study using claims data is a logical next step in providing more generalizable economic metrics.

Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with inferior clinical outcomes after surgical management of many orthopedic conditions. The purpose of this systematic review was to define the clinical, functional, and patient-reported outcomes of shoulder arthroplasty (SA) in patients with PD.

Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search was completed using the Ovid platform for searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews, with additional searches in Web of Sci-ence and Scopus. Included studies were full-length, English-language, clinical investigations reporting on SA in patients with PD with at least one clinical outcome.

Results: Seven studies including 7126 patients (7134 SA) met inclusion criteria with a mean age of 72.6 (range, 69.5e75.8 years), 58.9% female, and the average follow-up duration was 65 months (range, 17 e119 months). Anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) was the most reported implant surgery (n ? 3455, 48.4%) followed by hemiarthroplasty (HA) (n ? 2840, 39.8%), and reverse shoulder arthro-plasty (RSA) (n ? 839,1.8%). SA consistently improved pain. Forward elevation, abduction, and external rotation had a pooled mean increase of 36 , 20 , and 6 , respectively. Complications occurred at a pooled rate of 22.5%, with stiffness (7.1%), need for revision (5.3%), and instability (4.7%) as the most common complications reported. Reoperations inclusive of revisions occurred at a lower pooled rate of 5.6%, with aTSA (n ? 201; 9.0%) having the highest rate, followed by HA (n ? 158; 7.1%), and then RSA (n ? 42; 1.9%). Conclusions: The results of the present systematic review demonstrate that SA in patients with PD results in consistent pain relief. However, inferior improvements in clinical outcomes may be expected when compared with patients without PD, likely due to the neurodegenerative manifestations of this disorder. In addition, RSA had a lower reoperation rate than HA and aTSA in patients with PD.

   Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurode-generative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease.8 The annual inci-dence of PD is 20.5 cases per 100,000 individuals, with a lifetime risk of 2% in men and 1.3% in women.8,11 Disease onset typically follows a progressive course after 50 years of age with a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms.13 Motor symptoms include brady-kinesia, muscle rigidity, flexed posture, asymmetric limb resting tremor, and postural instability, while nonmotor symptoms are cognitive impairment and depression.13,16


Methods

Literature search

   This systematic review investigating the outcomes of PD in SA was conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta analyses) 27-item checklist (Fig. 1). The comprehensive literature review was completed on June 8, 2021, using MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane, Web of Sci-ence, and Scopus library databases. Search terms included “Par-kinson’s disease”, “Parkinson’s”, “shoulder arthroplasty”, “shoulder replacement”, “hemiarthroplasty”, “anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty”, and “reverse total shoulder arthroplasty”. The formal



strategy listing all search terms used and how they are combined is included in the Supplementary Appendix S1.

Eligibility criteria and study selection

   The inclusion criteria consisted of full-length publications written in the English language, publication in a peer-reviewed journal, level IV evidence or higher, and presence of at least 1 re-ported clinical outcome (common shoulder functional outcomes, complications, reoperations, or readmission). Exclusions entailed abstract-only reports, case reports, expert opinions, literature re-views, and studies with no reported outcomes.


Data extraction

   The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experi-enced librarian with input from the study investigators. Study de-mographics were subsequently collected by 2 blinded reviewers. These included the articles' author, publication year, study design, and level of evidence. Further patient-specific characteristics collected included sample size, mean age, sex, follow-up interval, arthroplasty type, functional outcome data, radiographic outcome data, complication rates, reoperations, and patient-reported outcome measures.
   

Statistical analysis

   Statistical analysis was performed with the combination of Microsoft Excel (Version 16.0.1; Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) and JMP Pro (Version 14.1.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Descriptive statistics were presented as means, medians, percent-ages, and standard deviation when appropriate. Continuous vari-ables were analyzed using Student t tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-square analysis or Fisher exact tests. When available, raw data were extracted and reported as pooled means if possible. Investigations with individual raw patient data without means and standard deviations were manually included into Microsoft Excel for inclusion into the final calculations. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.


Results

Study characteristics and patient demographics

   The initial literature search resulted in 29 total studies. No du-plicates were present, and all 29 studies were screened for inclu-sion and exclusion criteria. Subsequently, 17 unique studies were identified as potentially relevant, and full texts were assessed for eligibility. Seven clinical studies met criteria to be included in this systematic review, as demonstrated in Figure 1. A total of 7134 shoulders in 7126 patients were included in the analysis. Mean patient age at the time of arthroplasty was 72.6 (range, 69.5 e 75.8) years, 58.9% were female, and the average follow-up duration was 65 months (range, 17 e 119 months). Anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) was the most reported implant procedure (n ? 3455, 48.4%), followed by hemiarthroplasty (HA) (n ? 2840, 39.8%), and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) (n ? 839, 11.8%) (Table I).



Clinical and functional outcome measures

   Six out of the seven studies (n ? 102) reported pain as an outcome measure, all reporting general improvement after SA (Table II).2,4,5,7,9,10 Three studies (n ? 30) measured forward elevation, with a pooled postoperative mean of 75 .2,4,5 Of these investigations, two had preoperative data available demonstrating a pooled mean increase of 36 postoperatively.2,4 Five studies (n ? 99) measured abduction, with a pooled postoperative mean 97 and a mean increase of 20 postoperatively.2,4,7,9,10 Six studies (n ? 102) measured external rotation, with a pooled postoperative mean of 27 and a mean increase of 6 postoperatively.2,4, 5,7,9,10 Five studies (n ? 99) measured internal rotation with various reporting scales, none demonstrated any significant improvements from baseline (Table II).2,4,7,9,10

   Cusick et al4 (n ? 10) was the only study to report American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES) and simple shoulder test outcomes with a mean improvement of 33.7 to 51.0 (P ? .047)


and 1.3 to 3.8 (P ? .024), respectively. Borbas et al2 (n ? 17) was the only study to report SSV, absolute Constant-Murley score, and relative Constant-Murley bow score with mean improvements of 33.9 to 57.8 (P ? .005), 26.8 to 48.7 (P < .001), and 35 to 61.5 (P < .001), respectively. Three studies (n ? 66) reported outcome measures using the Neer result rating scale, with pooled categories of 24% excellent, 26% satisfactory, and 50% unsatisfactory.7,9,10

Shoulder-related complications, reoperations, and revisions

   All studies reported on postoperative complications with a pooled rate of 22.5% (1607/7134) (Table III). Stiffness was the most common pooled complication (n ? 505; 7.1%), followed by an un-listed need for revision (n ? 381; 5.3%), and then instability (n ? 381; 4.7%). When tiered by implant, stiffness, need for revision, and instability remained the top three categories for HA, TSA, and RSA (Table IV). Reoperations inclusive of revisions occurred at a pooled rate of 5.6% (401/7134), with revisions accounting for 398 of 401 reoperations also occurring at a pooled rate of 5.6%. When categorized by implants, aTSA had the highest reoperation rate (n ? 201; 9.0%) followed by HA (n ? 158; 7.1%), and then RSA (n ? 42; 1.9%).


Discussion

   PD is a neurodegenerative disorder that presents a clinical challenge with respect to surgical management of orthopedic conditions, including SA. Studies examining outcomes of SA in PD are scarce, with the available data limited to smaller retrospective investigations. The results of our systematic review indicate that SA provided patients with PD adequate pain relief. However, func-tional benefits after SA remained limited, with small increases in ROM and marginal patient-reported outcome improvements. Complications occurred at a pooled rate of 22.5%, with stiffness (7.1%), need for revision (5.3%), and instability (4.7%) as the most common issues. Despite this, reoperations inclusive of revisions occurred at a lower pooled rate of 5.6%, with aTSA (9.0%) having the highest rate, followed by HA (7.1%), and RSA (1.9%) with the lowest rate.


   The clinical studies included in this review all demonstrated improvement in pain after SA. Koch et al7 first evaluated the effects of SA in 15 PD patients, demonstrating discouraging functional results but reasonable success in pain relief after unconstrained aTSA. In a further review of subsequent studies with matched co-horts, Cusick et al4 demonstrated similar postoperative VAS pain and ASES pain scores of PD patients to a matched RSA cohort. Similarly, Borbas et al2 observed equivalent pain improvement after RSA in patients with PD compared with their matched cohort. Unlike pain relief, functional improvement in this cohort has his-torically been poor.7 In the present review, forward elevation had a pooled postoperative mean of 75 with mean increases of abduction to 36 and external rotation to 6 , with these differences remaining below the described minimal clinically important dif-ferences after TSA and RSA.15

   In addition, patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction were also marginal. In studies including the Neer rating scale, up to 50% of SA had an unsatisfactory result, notably implants included were either HA or aTSA.7,9,10 Despite this, some benefits after RSA have been reported by Cusick et al,4 with improvements of ASES and simple shoulder test similar to matched controls. Borbas et al2 also noticed improvement in SSV, absolute Constant-Murley score, and relative Constant-Murley bow score but at lower postoperative values than matched RSA controls. These outcomes are likely affected by the poor muscle control, rigidity, and bradykinesia of PD, which may limit the ability of SA and associated implants to improve the compromised shoulder girdle. To combat this, modi-fications of the surgical technique to include appropriate soft-tissue releases, optimized component positioning, early mobilization, prolonged physical therapy, and botulinum toxin A use have been described with unclear benefits.2-5,7,9,10


   In this review, complications remained a notable problem, with a pooled rate of 22.5%. Postoperative stiffness was the most often described complication, at a rate of 7.1%, which is consistent with the ROM findings in the literature. Although soft-tissue tension and component positioning play a role in subsequent ROM, the ability to successfully engage in physical therapy likely also contributes to the outcome. As such, the combination of rigidity, bradykinesia, and dementia may translate into a limited ceiling for postoperative ROM improvements in these patients. Instability was also observed at an elevated rate of 4.7%. Initial investigations highlighted that this may be an issue limited to unconstrained SA, but more recent studies including this review continued to demonstrate higher rates of instability in RSA as well.2,4 As patients with PD have asynchronous motor function, constant tremors, and lack complete volitional muscle control, this may place the shoulder at elevated risks of implant loosening and instability events.


   In the present review, reoperations inclusive of revisions occurred at a pooled rate of 5.6%, with revision arthroplasty ac-counting for 99.3% of described reoperations (398 of 401). In studies with matched cohorts, PD demonstrated higher reoperation rates than their respective RSA control groups.2 ,4 Similarly, Burrus et al3 demonstrated an independent increase in revision rates after HA, aTSA, and RSA when compared with matched controls in a large national database investigation. In a review of their in-dications for revisions, they included traditionally common reasons for revision SA: instability, infection, periprosthetic fracture, and component loosening. As such, the observed increased risk of complications in patients with PD remains multifactorial and likely stems from the underlying manifestations of the disease, including the motor and nonmotor components. Interestingly, when reop-eration was compared by implant type, RSA demonstrated a lower pooled rate of 1.9% than the 9.0% in aTSA and 7.1% in HA. This may suggest that RSA may be more accommodating of PD with respect to subsequent revision. However, this outcome may also be limited by the shorter follow-up of RSA studies because of the more recent introduction of the implant as compared to HA and aTSA.


   Although this systematic review provides a broad overview of SA in the context of PD, it should be viewed within the context of certain limitations. The present investigation limited the search to articles with full text published in the English language, which may have resulted in exclusion of other relevant literature as well as potential selection bias. Subsequently, this study included many heterogenous retrospective studies spanning multiple decades with different numbers of patients, follow-up intervals, measured clinical outcomes, and varied implant use with unknown details on the surgical indications. In addition, most of the included patients aTSA, anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty; HA, hemiarthroplasty; RSA, reverse shoulder arthroplasty; ORIF, open reduction internal fixation.


were acquired from the study by Burrus et al,3 which heavily in-fluences the current analysis, especially the rates of complications and revision surgery. Therefore, it was difficult to consistently pool all variables to generate a complete meta-analysis. As such, the present investigation performed a qualitative systematic review with quantitative calculations whenever feasible.

Conclusion

   The results of the present systematic review demonstrate that SA in patients with PD likely results in consistent pain relief. However, inferior improvements in clinical outcomes may be expected, likely due to the neurodegenerative manifestations of


this disorder. An elevated rate of complications was observed in the literature with a pooled rate of 22.5%. However, revisions were much lower with a 5.6% pooled rate. RSA may be the most accommodating implant type to PD, with a lower rate of revisions.

Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an abnormal physiological condition that has been increasingly identified as a risk factor for complications after orthopedic surgery. Given the lack of information on the effect of MetS in shoulder arthroplasty (SA), this inves-tigation analyzed the rates of postoperative complications and implant survivorship free from reoperation and revision in patients with and without MetS.

Methods: Between 2007 and 2017, data from 4635 adults who underwent a primary SA were collected and classified based on the pres-ence or absence of MetS. MetS was defined as the existence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a minimum of 2 of the following diagnoses: hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and body mass index 30 kg/m2 within 1 year of surgery. Of the 4635 arthroplasties, 714 were performed in patients with MetS (anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty [aTSA] in 289 and reverse shoulder arthroplasty [RSA] in 425) and 3921 were performed in patients without MetS (aTSA in 1736 and RSA in 2185). Demographic characteristics, complications, reoperations, and revision surgery were compared.

Results: At a mean of follow-up of 4.5 2.3 years, 67 MetS patients (9.4%) and 343 non-MetS patients (8.7%) had sustained at least 1 postoperative complication (P ? .851). Rotator cuff failure was the most common complication overall, with 84 cases (1.8%) (15 MetS cases [2.1%] and 69 non-MetS cases [1.8%], P ? .851), and in both MetS and non-MetS patients, followed by infection, with 68 cases (1.2%) (10 MetS cases [1.4%] and 58 non-MetS cases [1.2%], P ? .913). For aTSAs, the most common complication was rotator cuff failure (84 shoulders, 1.8%); for RSAs, the most common complication was periprosthetic fracture (52 shoulders, 1.1%). In RSAs, the rates of deep infection (1.9% vs. 0.7%, P ? .04), instability (3.1% vs. 1.5%, P ? .04), and deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary em-bolism (0.5% vs. 0.3%, P ? .03) were found to be significantly higher in patients with MetS than in those without MetS. Reoperations were observed in 36 MetS patients (5%) and 170 non-MetS patients (4.3%) (P ? .4). Revisions were performed in 30 MetS patients (4.2%) and 127 non-MetS patients (3.2%) (P ? .19). The Kaplan-Meier 5-year rate of survivorship free from reoperation, revision, and prosthetic joint infection was equal between groups.

Conclusions: A preoperative diagnosis of MetS in patients undergoing primary SA did not significantly increase the risk of postoper-ative complications, infection, reoperation, or revision following primary SA. However, in the RSA subgroup, complications were significantly more common in patients with MetS. Individual risk factors may be more appropriate than the umbrella diagnosis of MetS prior to aTSA.


  Shoulder arthroplasty (SA) continues to be an increas-ingly performed procedure for the management of a wide range of glenohumeral disorders.3,16 In the United States, SA has demonstrated growth rates comparable to or greater than those of total hip and knee replacements, with future projections predicting up to a 9-fold increase by 2030 in both elderly and younger patients.25,30 As a result, post-operative adverse outcomes, revisions, and significant costs to the health care system can be expected,10,12,36,31 providing opportunities to identify risk factors that may improve the outcomes of these procedures.2

  Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex disorder often defined by abnormal components of insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and abdominal obesity.1,15 This constellation of inter-related biochemical, physiological, and clinical traits has been associated with cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic events, endocrine dysfunction, and changes in health-related quality of life.6,11,20 MetS has also been suggested to influence the development of osteoarthritis independent of body mass index (BMI).4,12,13 In the perioperative setting, MetS has been associated with increased all-cause mortality rates and postoperative com-plications.7 In orthopedics, MetS has been associated with increased in-hospital complications after ankle fractures21 and prolonged lengths of stay after cervical fusion.19 Regarding hip and knee arthroplasty, MetS has been iden-tified as an independent risk factor for short-term compli-cations, wound issues, and readmissions irrespective of obesity class.8

  Within the shoulder literature, only 2 studies have explored the impact of MetS in patients undergoing SA.14,24 Both used national inpatient databases focusing on short-term outcomes (Nationwide Inpatient Sample [NIS] and American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program [NSQIP]). Murphy et al24 demonstrated elevated perioperative medical complica-tions and surgical-site infections, as well as prolonged hospital stays, in patients with MetS. In contrast, Garcia et al10 concluded that MetS was not a significant predictor of postoperative complications or an extended length of stay. As a result, there remains a relative paucity of clear and concise data on the outcomes of MetS in patients un-dergoing shoulder replacement. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of MetS on the rates of post-operative complications, infection, and implant survivor-ship free from reoperation and revision. We hypothesized

that patients with MetS would be more likely to have increased risks of subsequent complications and infections, as well as lower implant survivorship free from reoperation and revision.

Materials and methods

Data for this retrospective comparative cohort study were acquired from a prospectively recorded institutional total joint registry database. All adults who underwent a primary SA (N ? 4635) between January 2007 and December 2017 were identified. MetS was defined using preset criteria consisting of the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a minimum of 2 of the following di-agnoses: hyperlipidemia, hypertension requiring medication, and BMI 30 kg/m2. This definition was selected based on prior published literature used in other database investigations on MetS.8,11,19,21 A subsequent chart review was performed to identify all patients who met the criteria for MetS within 1 year of surgery. The exclusion criteria included patients aged < 18 years, revision SAs, hemiarthroplasties, malignant diagnoses, or <2 years of clinical follow-up. In the case of bilateral SA, only the first shoulder was counted and included in the investigation. The final cohort was then categorized into 714 patients with MetS (anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty [aTSA] in 289 and reverse shoulder arthroplasty [RSA] in 425) and 3921 patients without a diagnosis of MetS (aTSA in 1736 and RSA in 2185). Baseline demographic characteristics and comorbidities are detailed in Table I.

   Through a combined retrospective chart review and extraction of data from our institutional total joint registry database, we obtained primary and secondary outcome measures. The primary outcome measures of the study included postoperative surgical complications and implant survivorship free from revision and reoperation. Secondary outcome measures included postoperative infections (superficial or deep) and revision due to prosthetic joint infection. Superficial infections were classified as those limited to the skin and subcutaneous tissue with no extension beyond the fascial planes. Deep infections were defined as infections beyond the superficial fascial planes.

   Statistical analysis was completed using SPSS Statistics soft-ware (version 25; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Baseline character-istics were compared using the Student t test, c2, or Fisher exact test as indicated. The McNemar test was performed for paired categorical data and the Wilcoxon signed rank analysis was used for continuous variables. Survivorship free from reoperation, revision, and periprosthetic joint infection was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. In all cases, P < .05 was considered sta-tistically significant.
   

Results

Complications

Perioperative complications were observed in 410 cases (8.9%) across the entire cohort of 4635 shoulders included in this study. With respect to timing, 108 complications (26.3%) occurred within 30 days; 194 (47.3%), within 90 days; 273 (66.6%), within 1 year; and 371 (90.5%), by 5 years. Complication rates were equal between the MetS group (n ? 67, 9.4%) and non-MetS group (n ? 343, 8.7%) (P ? .851) (Table II). Rotator cuff failure was the most common complication, observed in 84 shoulders (1.8%); this was followed by infection (n ? 66, 1.4%) and peri-prosthetic fracture (n ? 65, 1.4%). For MetS cases spe-cifically, rotator cuff failure was the most common complication (n ? 15, 2.1%), followed by instability (n ? 15, 2.1%) and periprosthetic fracture (n ? 11, 1.5%). For the non-MetS patients, rotator cuff failure was the most common complication (n ? 69, 1.8%), followed by infec-tion (n ? 58, 1.4%) and periprosthetic fracture (n ? 54, 1.4%). With respect to infections, no significant differences were found between patients with MetS (n ? 10, 1.4%) and those without MetS (n ? 56, 1.4%) (P ? .913). Deep in-fections were observed in 9 patients (1.3%) with MetS and 37 (0.9%) without MetS (P ? .41), and superficial in-fections were observed in 1 patient (0.1%) with MetS and 21 patients (0.5%) without MetS (P ? .23).

   Given the differences in complication profiles between total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and RSA, a subanalysis was performed comparing complications by implant type (Table III). There were 181 TSA complications (3.9%), of which the most common were rotator cuff failure (n ? 84, 1.8%), infection (n ? 29, 0.6%), and aseptic component loosening (n ? 23, 0.5%). There were no differences in the overall complication rate between the MetS cohort (n ? 25, 8.7%) and non-MetS cohort (n ? 156, 9.0%) (P ? .91) or
with respect to the individual complication types. There were 229 RSA complications (4.9%), which was signifi-cantly higher in comparison to the TSA cohort (P ? .014). Within the RSA subgroup, the most common complications were periprosthetic fracture (n ? 52, 1.1%), instability (n ? 46, 0.9%), and acromial or scapular spine fracture (n ? 41, 0.9%). There were no differences between the overall MetS cohort (n ? 42, 9.9%) and non-MetS cohort (n ? 187, 8.6%) as a whole (P ? .34). However, with respect to the individual complication types, we found that the rates of deep infection (1.9% vs. 0.7%, P ? .04), instability (3.1% vs. 1.5%, P ? .04), and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) (0.5% vs. 0.3%, P ? .03) were significantly higher in patients with MetS than in those without MetS.

Survivorship free from revision, reoperation, and prosthetic joint infection

At a mean follow-up of 4.5 years (range, 2-13 years), reoperations occurred in 206 shoulders (4.4%), with no difference between patients with MetS (n ? 36, 5%) and those without MetS (n ? 170, 4.3%) (P ? .4). Revisions, requiring replacement of 1 or more components, occurred in 157 shoulders (3.4%), with no difference between pa-tients with MetS (n ? 30, 4.2%) and those without MetS (n

? 127, 3.2%) (P ? .19). Revision for prosthetic joint in-fections occurred in 47 cases (1%), with no difference be-

tween patients with MetS (n ? 7, 1%) and those without MetS (n ? 40, 1%) (P ? .92) (Table IV).
   The rate of 5-year survivorship free from reoperation was 92.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.4%-95.4%) in the MetS group and a 95.0% (95% CI, 94.1%-95.9%) in the non-MetS group. There was a significantly higher rate of

early reoperation in shoulders with MetS (P ? .016) but no observed difference at 5 years (P ? .11) (Fig. 1). Survi-vorship free from revision followed a similar pattern, with


between groups (99.0% [95% CI, 98.1%-99.9%] in MetS group and 98.8% [95% CI, 98.4%-99.2%] in non-MetS group, P ? .85) (Fig. 3).

Discussion

MetS remains a public health epidemic associated with elevated perioperative mortality rates, complications, and socioeconomic costs.6,7 With up to one-third of all US adults affected by MetS, the rising demand for SA will likely result in the need for managing patients with this

complex disorder. In this study, 15.4% of patients under-going primary SA at our institution had a concurrent diagnosis of MetS. In contrast to our hypothesis, a preop-erative diagnosis of MetS did not significantly affect rates of postoperative complications (MetS, 9.4%; non-MetS, 8.7%), infections (MetS, 1.4%; non-MetS, 1.4%), reoper-ations (MetS, 5%; non-MetS, 4.3%), or revision surgery (MetS, 4.2%; non-MetS, 3.2%). However, when we eval-uated individual complications in the RSA subgroup, MetS was associated with a significantly higher rate of deep infection (1.9% vs. 0.7%, P ? .04) and instability (3.1% vs. 1.5%, P ? .04).

   Given the increasing prevalence of MetS, several studies have been performed evaluating perioperative outcomes. Murphy et al24 investigated in-hospital outcomes of pa-tients with MetS by use of the NIS database. They reported a prevalence of MetS of 10.8% among shoulders treated between 2002 and 2011. MetS was found to be a risk factor for in-hospital adverse events, longer hospital stays, and

non-homebound discharges. Garcia et al10 similarly evalu-ated short-term outcomes of patients with MetS and obesity undergoing primary SA by use of the American College of Surgeons NSQIP database from 2005 to 2013. They re-ported no significant difference in postoperative compli-cations or extended lengths of stay. Although both of these investigations raise awareness of MetS in SA, both report 2038	E. Marigi et al.

secondary data analyses of administrative databases, which limit the clinical information available. Specifically, the NIS database used by Murphy et al was limited to a 20% sample of hospitals nationwide with follow-up until the time of discharge. The NSQIP database used by Garcia et al is a prospectively collected database and provides slightly improved follow-up but is limited to short-term reporting of outcomes, up to 30 days postoperatively. In our cohort, only 26.3% of complications were present by 30 days and 47.3% were present by 90 days postoperatively, which leaves the potential for the prior studies to miss complications that accumulate over time with additional follow-up.29

  When complications were compared by implant type, our investigation did observe a slightly increased risk of complications with RSA compared with TSA (4.9% vs. 3.9%, P ?.014). Of note, both rates were largely lower than the historical rate of surgical complications of 15%6 and the more contemporary rate of 11%.5 Regardless, elevated complications in RSA vs. TSA have recently been described by Botros et al,5 who reported a 6.2 times higher odds of perioperative implant-related complications and 2 times increased odds of red blood cell transfusion with RSA compared with TSA by use of the NIS database. They demonstrated that instability and dislocation comprised the majority of perioperative implant-related complications. In our study, deep infection (1.9% vs. 0.7%, P ? .04), insta-bility (3.1% vs. 1.5%, P ? .04), and DVT or PE (0.5% vs. 0.3%, P ? .03) were observed at higher rates in RSA cases with MetS vs. those without MetS. These findings were supportive of our hypothesis that MetS may serve as a potential risk factor for complications; however, compara-ble findings were not observed in TSA cases.

  Part of this observation may be due to some inherent differences between the RSA and TSA groups. Focusing on deep infections, revision for deep infection has been investigated and found to occur at an elevated rate in RSA patients as compared with TSA patients, even when adjusted for sex, age, diagnosis, and year of surgery.22 Moreover, previous non-arthroplasty surgery is a risk fac-tor for deep infection in primary SA patients,35 which often is more common in RSA patients. With respect to insta-bility, recent data have suggested that this complication is fairly unique to RSA,26 which would support the minimal numbers observed in our TSA group. Previously described risk factors for DVT and/or PE in SA include higher BMI and diabetes, among others.33 However, at present, there are no investigations that suggest higher DVT and/or PE rates in RSA vs. TSA. As such, this may be an undescribed finding; however, given the small numbers of complications in general, there is also potential for undersampling and data fragility.

  There remain no data evaluating the effect of MetS on survivorship regarding reoperation, revision, and infection. A similar study by Ledford et al evaluating total hip arthroplasties at the same institution in patients with MetS showed significantly decreased survivorship free from


reoperation, revision, and infection in patients with a pre-operative diagnosis of MetS (C.L., unpublished data, February 2021). However, unlike after total hip arthro-plasty, MetS did not have a significant effect on survivor-ship after primary SA. This is in contrast to our hypothesis that MetS would lead to higher rates of reoperations and revisions.

   Although MetS is a grouping of individual diagnoses, obesity and diabetes mellitus individually have previously been associated with worse outcomes following SA.23,27 With respect to obesity and SA, previous investigations have demonstrated increased rates of postoperative com-plications and revision surgery in patients with BMI > 50 kg/m2,34 as well as BMI > 35 kg/m2.16,34 However, Savin et al28 recently reported a retrospective age-matched anal-ysis demonstrating no difference among 5 BMI groups with respect to complications, reoperations, patient-reported outcome scores, and range of motion. This was further supported by a recent meta-analysis by Klein et al15 that also showed no difference in complications between pa-

tients with a BMI < 30 kg/m2 and those with a BMI > 30 kg/m2.

   Similarly to BMI, multiple studies have evaluated the effect of diabetes on outcomes following primary SA. Collectively, these studies have demonstrated increased risks of a prolonged hospital stay, non-routine discharge, and 90-day readmission.9,17,18 These effects are more pro-nounced among patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who demonstrate increased risks of postoperative complications and blood transfusions,9 suggesting worse outcomes with poorer control. One reason for the lack of difference in our study may be related to preoperative glycemic control. Within our institution, all patients with a history of diabetes are evaluated with a preoperative hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level. Currently, in our practice, elective SA is delayed until glycemic control is achieved as measured by an HbA1c level < 8%. Theoretically, tighter glycemic control may mitigate the potential risks associated with diabetes and its subsequent contribution to the MetS complication profile. However, Statz et al32 performed a retrospective review of 406 SAs and demonstrated no dif-ference in complications, reoperations, revisions, or in-fections with increased HbA1c level as a continuous variable or as a dichotomous variable with a cutoff of 7.0%.

  Overall, the evaluation of obesity and diabetes individ-ually has failed to demonstrate a significant increase in longer-term complications, reoperations, revisions, and in-fections. When evaluated collectively in the setting of MetS, these findings are supported by our study, which found no association between MetS and postoperative complications, reoperations, or revision surgery after pri-mary SA. The lack of correlation in our investigation could be due to several reasons. Most clearly, it could be that there is no actual correlation between MetS and SA. Alternatively, methodologic limitations of our investigation could have led to the inability to identify any correlations.
  

First, this is a retrospective analysis and subject to selection bias, as well as lack of randomization, and it did not capture any patients who were otherwise deemed unfit for surgery. We attempted to control for this through use of a pro-spectively collected institutional database and use of a comparative control group. Second, we used previously published and preset criteria used in other orthopedic studies to define MetS, but major variations in the exact definition of MetS still exist. We attempted to limit this by using previously published criteria within the orthopedic literature; however, even in this subset of studies, there continues to be variability that could confound this inves-tigation. Third, the current database did not have any detailed preoperative information about the management of MetS and its comorbid conditions, as well as whether pa-tients were adherent to any treatment, if present.

Conclusion

In this investigation, MetS was identified in 15.4% of patients undergoing primary SA and did not significantly alter the rate of postoperative complications or survi-vorship free from reoperation or revision surgery. However, in the RSA subgroup, complications were significantly more common in patients with MetS. In-dividual risk factors may be more appropriate than the umbrella diagnosis of MetS prior to aTSA.

Primary reverse shoulder arthroplasty: how did medialized and glenoid-based lateralized style prostheses compare at 10 years?

Justin C. Kennon, MD, Chad Songy, MD, Douglas Bartels, MD, Joseph Statz, MD, Robert H. Cofield, MD, John W. Sperling, MD, MBA, Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo, MD, PhD*



Background: The purpose of this study was to compare long-term outcomes, complications, and reop-eration rates of primary reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) performed at a single institution using 2 implant designs: a Grammont medialized prosthesis (medialized [M] group) and a Frankle glenoid-based lateralized prosthesis (glenoid-lateralized [GL] group).

Methods: Between 2004 and 2008, 100 consecutive single-institution primary RTSAs were performed by reconstructive shoulder surgeons who were not design consultants, with the aim of obtaining 10-year follow-up: 56 in the M group and 44 in the GL group. Patients were followed up until death, until revi-sion surgery, or for a minimum of 10 years.

Results: Of 100 patients, 87 had more than 2 years’ follow-up (mean, 77 months). A subset analysis of 41 patients with an average of 10.2 years’ follow-up showed sustained long-term outcomes. RTSA pro-vided clinical improvements without significant differences between the M and GL groups, except for improved active forward elevation in the M group (144 in M group vs. 115 in GL group, P ?

.002). Reoperation was required in 6 shoulders (10-year cumulative incidence of 3 [5%] in M group vs. 3 [8%] in GL group) for a total of 16 complications (10-year cumulative incidence of 8 [14%] in M group vs. 8 [20%] in GL group). Notching rates were significantly higher in the M group (77% in M group vs. 47% in GL group, P ? .013); differences in severe notching (grade 3 or 4) were clinically relevant but did not reach statistical significance (23% in M group vs. 9% in GL group, P ? .22).

Conclusion: Primary RTSA using these first 2 prosthesis designs was associated with good outcomes and low reoperation (5%-8%) and complication (14%-20%) rates at 10 years. The M group had higher rates of notching. These results may provide a benchmark for comparison with newer implants, espe-cially considering that these results include the early RTSA implantation learning curve.

  Since its approval by the US Food and Drug Admin-istration in November 2003, reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) use has seen increasing popularity. Previous studies have shown an overall increase in the number of total shoulder arthroplasties performed in the United States between 2002 and 2011.9,15,22 RTSA use has played a significant role in the acceleration in the number of total shoulder arthroplasties performed, with roughly 10,000 RTSAs performed in the United States in 2007, a 5-fold increase over 2004.12 Estimates indicate that 30,000 reverse total shoulder arthroplasties (RTSAs) were per-formed in 2012.15 In addition, a recent study showed RTSAs accounting for 42% of all primary shoulder arthroplasties in 2011.14

  Along with the aging population, RTSA has evolved to see broadened indications and alternate prosthetic de-signs.14 Complication rates have been reported to range from 19% to 68%, including infection, instability, me-chanical implant failure or dissociation, acromial or spine

fracture, scapular notching, periprosthetic fracture, and neurologic injury.1,3-5,10,12,20,21,23 Bacle et al2 recently re-

ported on their long-term outcomes with a mean follow-up period of 12.5 years. They reported an overall complication rate of 29%, with 10% occurring after 2 years. Although surgeon experience may play a role in the complication profile, even conservative reports of complication rates are concerning as the popularity of the implant grows in the United States.

  The majority of long-term studies on RTSA have re-ported on the traditional Grammont-style prosthesis. Bacle et al2 reported a 93% 10-year overall prosthetic survival rate free of revision. Early on, our institution adopted 2 different RTSA designs: one design combining a medial-ized glenoid with a 155 inlay polyethylene humeral component along the principles of Dr. Grammont and another design combining a lateralized glenoid with a 135 inlay polyethylene humeral component according to the principles proposed by Dr. Frankle.7 Frankle’s later-alized glenoid design was aimed at providing a greater impingement-free range of motion and restoring optional muscle length-tension dynamics. Initially, cemented fixa-tion of the humeral component was recommended for both designs.

  The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term outcomes, notching rates, complications, and reoperation rates of primary RTSA performed at a single institution using both implant designs: the Grammont medialized prosthesis (medialized [M] group) and the Frankle glenoid-based lateralized prosthesis (glenoid-lateralized [GL] group). We hypothesized that there would be no significant difference in long-term clinical outcomes, complications, or reoperation rates between the 2 groups, but we expected to see higher rates of notching in the Grammont prosthesis group.


Materials and methods

Our institutional joint registry database was queried to identify all primary RTSAs performed using a Delta III prosthesis (DePuy, Warsaw, IN, USA), Delta Xtend prosthesis (DePuy), or Encore/ DJO prosthesis (DJO Surgical, Austin, TX, USA) between 2004 and 2008. These study years were selected to provide the potential for 10 years of follow-up. Patients were included if they received a primary RTSA at our institution during the selected study years. Patients with a revision arthroplasty were excluded from this study. A total of 100 consecutive primary RTSAs were identified. Our joint registry database captures demographic and clinical variables at the time of joint arthroplasty and at postoperative follow-up times of 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years, as well as every 5 years thereafter. Patients are invited to return for a physical ex-amination and radiographs at each follow-up time interval. Those not returning for follow-up are assessed using a validated, patient-reported outcome survey that also assesses reoperations at outside institutions and requests that patients send us radiographs.19 We completed a retrospective review of this prospectively recorded information to collect clinical outcomes, complications, and reoperations. In addition, all available radiographs were reviewed according to the parameters detailed later.


Patient demographic characteristics and selection criteria

This study analyzed 100 consecutive primary RTSAs performed by 1 of 4 reconstructive shoulder surgeons. There were 66 female and 34 male patients, the average age was 73.7 years (range, 55-86 years) at the time of surgery, and the mean BMI was 29.9 (range, 17-45.5) (Table I). Most RTSAs (90 of 100, 90%) were performed for cuff tear arthropathy, with a few performed for sequelae of proximal humeral fractures (7), post-traumatic arthritis (2), or avascular necrosis (1). Patients were followed up until death, revision surgery, or their most recent clinical evalua-tion. The average follow-up time for the whole cohort was 77 months. A subset analysis was performed excluding patients with less than 7 years of follow-up, which yielded an average follow-up period of 123 months for 41 patients.

Implant selection and operative technique

As mentioned before, all RTSA procedures were performed using 1 of 2 prosthesis designs: a Grammont-style prosthesis with a medialized center of rotation and 155 polyethylene cemented inlay humeral component (Delta III or Delta Xtend) or

a Frankle-style prosthesis with a lateralized center of rotation and

a cemented inlay humeral component with a 135 polyethylene angle (Encore). Implant selection was based on surgeon prefer-ence. All stems were cemented, and no augmentations or bone grafts were used on the glenoid. There were 56 shoulders in the M group and 44 shoulders in the GL group. A standard delto-pectoral approach was used for all procedures, along with a standard repair of the subscapularis tendon when tissue integrity allowed. All patients were immobilized for at least 2 weeks, with longer periods of immobilization for shoulders with sub-scapularis repairs.



Follow-up information

At most recent analysis, 48% of patients (48 of 100) were deceased with their implants in place. This finding is not unex-pected given the elapsed time from surgery over a decade ago for many of these elderly patients at the time of their index procedure. In the M group, 28 of 56 patients were deceased, with an average time from surgery to death of 7 years. In the GL group, 20 of 44 patients were deceased, with an average time from surgery to death of 6.9 years.

   Of the 100 patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasties in this study, 12 died before 2-year follow-up whereas only 1 sur-vivor was lost to follow-up before 2 years. When we exclude these 13 patients who died or were lost to follow-up before 2 years, the remaining 87 shoulders had an average clinical follow-up time of 87.2 months (range, 25-161 months). For the whole group of 100 shoulders, the average radiographic follow-up time was 52.6 months (range, 0-132 months). In addition to the 13 patients who died or were lost to follow-up before 2 years, 11 patients were lost to radiographic follow-up before 2 years. When those lost to radiographic follow-up before the 2-year mark are excluded, 76 patients were included for postoperative analysis, with an average radiographic follow-up period of 67 months (range, 25-132 months).

Clinical outcome assessment

The primary outcome of this study was revision surgery for removal or replacement of a humeral stem or glenoid metaglene. Secondary outcomes included reoperation for any reason, other complications, pain, and range of motion before surgery and at most recent follow-up. Patients were asked to quantify their pain preoperatively and postoperatively with a visual analog scale pain score (0, none; 1-3, mild; 4-7, moderate; or 8-10, severe) or to simply categorize their pain by those same descriptors. Range of motion was either determined by clinical examination at last follow-up or extracted from the standardized joint registry patient-completed questionnaire.

Radiographic assessment

Two fellowship-trained reconstructive shoulder surgeons and two orthopedic surgeons in training as fellows in shoulder and elbow surgery reviewed preoperative radiographs, radiographs obtained within the first 3 months after surgery, and radiographs obtained at most recent follow-up. Standard 3-view preoperative radiographs
(internal anteroposterior, external anteroposterior, and axillary lateral) were reviewed to determine the following radiographic parameters: glenoid bone loss (none, mild, moderate, or severe), glenoid morphology according to the Favard classification for shoulders with cuff tear arthropathy, degree of subluxation (none, mild, moderate, or severe), and direction of humeral subluxation.6,13

   Early postoperative and most recent follow-up radiographs were reviewed for the presence and extent (complete or incom-plete) of linear lucency at the glenoid-implant or humerus-implant interface. Radiographic loosening was defined as a clear change in component position or a complete radiolucent line over 2 mm in thickness. Inferior scapular notching was reviewed and graded as described by the Nerot-Sirveaux classification.17

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics are reported as mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) for continuous measures and as fre-quencies and percentages for categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared between groups using either a t test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate, and categorical vari-ables were compared between groups using either the c2 or Fisher exact test. The time-to-event outcomes of reoperations and com-plications were assessed using competing-risks analysis, in which death was considered the competing event. Kaplan-Meier survi-vorship curves were detailed to determine survivorship rates for the prostheses, with the endpoints defined as revision or resection for any reason. The a level was set at .05 for statistical significance.


Results

Complications and reoperations

At most recent follow-up, only 6 shoulders among 100 primary RTSAs have required reoperation (10-year cumu-lative incidence of 3 [5%] in M group vs. 3 [8%] in GL group; hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-6.43; P ? .75); the reasons for reoperation were dislocation

(2), polyethylene disassociation (1), glenosphere disasso-ciation (1), infection (1), and acromial stress fracture (1). Other complications included intraoperative or post-operative periprosthetic fractures (6), acromial stress

fractures (2), brachial plexopathy (1), and a distal clavicle insufficiency fracture (1), for a total of 16 complications for both groups (10-year cumulative incidence of 8 [14%] in M group vs. 8 [20%] in GL group; hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-3.50; P ? .59) (Table II).

  There were 3 reoperations in the M group. One shoulder had polyethylene disassociation requiring revision within 3 months after surgery. The other reoperations comprised open reduction and internal fixation of a symptomatic acromial fracture 1 year after surgery and revision in a single patient with recurrent instability at 4 years. No secondary procedures were required for these 3 patients after their initial reoperations.

  In the GL group, reoperations were performed for recurrent dislocation in 1 patient and for glenosphere disassociation in another patient within 60 days of surgery. These 2 patients underwent no further procedures. In another patient, reoperation was performed for a deep infection requiring superficial surgical wound exploration and debridement 10 years after surgery. This patient died 3 months after debridement and never underwent a formal implant revision procedure.

  The overall reoperation rate was 6% (6 of 100), and the overall complication rate was 16% (16 of 100). Kaplan-Meier cumulative-incidence curves are displayed in Figure 1.

Medialized design outcome (M group)

A total of 56 RTSAs were performed in this study using the Grammont-style prosthesis. With the exclusion of the 7 patients who died within the first 2 years after surgery, the average clinical follow-up time was 85.2 months (range, 25-161 months). Preoperatively, 90% of the patients re-ported moderate or severe pain; at most recent follow-up, 90% of the patients reported no or mild pain. RTSA led to improvements in mean active forward elevation (from 65 to 144 , P < .001) and mean active external rotation (from 23 to 48 , P < .001).

Preoperative radiographs revealed moderate or severe

superior subluxation of the humeral head in 100% of pa-

tients with cuff tear arthropathy. The Favard classification

of glenoid erosion preoperatively showed the following

grades for the 48 cuff tear arthropathy shoulders: E0 in 21

(43.8%), E1 in 8 (16.7%), E2 in 13 (27.1%), and E3 in 6

(12.5%).

  Examination of the most recent postoperative radio-graphs of patients with minimum 2-year radiographic follow-up showed incomplete lucent lines around the humerus-cement interface of 24 of 44 patients (54.5%) (1

mm in 15 shoulders and 1.5 mm in 9 shoulders) and complete lucent lines around the humerus in 10 of 44 pa-tients (22.7%) (1 mm in 5 shoulders, 1.5 mm in 3 shoulders, and 2 mm in 2 shoulders). No shoulders had evidence of gross loosening on the humeral side. and only 1 shoulder


had evidence of loosening at the glenoid component–bone interface. The overall rate of radiographic loosening was 1 of 44 (2.27%), with a single shoulder demonstrating gle-noid shift. The overall notching rate was 34 of 44 (77.3%), with grade 1 in 15 shoulders, grade 2 in 9, grade 3 in 6, and grade 4 in 4. Severe notching (grade 3 or 4) was present in 22.7% of the shoulders (Table III).

Glenoid-lateralized design outcome (GL group)

A total of 44 RTSAs were performed in this study using a design with a lateralized center of rotation and a cemented inlay humeral component with a 135 polyethylene angle (Encore). Six patients did not have 2-year follow-up; 5 of 6 died before 2 years. For patients with minimum 2-year follow-up, the average clinical follow-up time was 88.8 months (range, 27-151 months) and the average radio-graphic follow-up time was 65.1 months (range, 26-131 months). A total of 12 patients were lost to radiographic follow-up before 2 years; 7 of these patients had died.

   Before surgery, all patients complained of moderate or severe pain. At most recent follow-up, 91% of the patients complained of no or mild pain (P < .001). RTSA using a glenoid-lateralized design resulted in improved active for-ward elevation (from 51 preoperatively to 116 at most recent follow-up, P <.001) and active external rotation (from 17 preoperatively to 38 at most recent follow-up, P <.001).
Preoperative radiographs revealed moderate or severe

superior subluxation of the humeral head in 100% of pa-

tients with cuff tear arthropathy. The Favard classification

of glenoid erosion preoperatively showed the following

grades for the 42 cuff tear arthropathy shoulders: E0 in 15

(35.7%), E1 in 8 (19.1%), E2 in 12 (28.6%), and E3 in 7

(16.7%).

   For shoulders with a minimum 2-year radiographic follow-up, at the most recent follow-up, there were incomplete lucent lines around the humerus-cement inter-face in 18 of 32 patients (56.3%) (1 mm in 9 shoulders and 1.5 mm in 9 shoulders), and 8 of 32 patients (25%) had complete lucent lines around the humerus (1 mm in 4 shoulders, 1.5 mm in 3 shoulders, and 2 mm in 1 shoulder). No patients had evidence of gross loosening on the humeral side, whereas 1 patient demonstrated evidence of loosening at the glenoid component–bone interface. The overall rate of radiographic loosening was 1 of 32 (3.1%), with glenoid shift in 1 of 32 (3.1%). The overall notching rate was 15 of 32 (46.9%), with grade 1 in 7 shoulders, grade 2 in 5, grade 3 in 2, and grade 4 in 1. Severe notching (grade 3 or 4) was present in 9.4% of the shoulders in this group.

Design comparison subset analysis

With the numbers available, differences in complication and reoperation rates between the M and GL groups did not reach statistical significance. Differences in pain and

T
motion were also not statistically significant except for improved active forward elevation in the M group (144 in M group vs. 115 in GL group, P ? .002). In addition, clinical outcomes were compared in a subset of 41 patients followed up for a mean of 10.2 years; the only statistically significant difference at long-term follow-up was better active elevation in the M group (Table IV).

  For shoulders with greater than 2 years of radiographic follow-up (44 in M group and 32 in GL group), overall notching rates were significantly higher in the M group (77% in M group vs. 47% in GL group, P ? .013). Dif-ferences in severe (grade 3 or 4) notching were clinically relevant but did not reach statistical significance (23% in M group vs. 9% in GL group, P ? .22). No significant dif-ference in component loosening on radiographs was noted (P ? .82).

Discussion

Since RTSA early adoption in the United States in 2004, there have been many RTSA design iterations aimed at maximizing function and longevity while limiting compli-cations and implant failure. However, the fundamental RTSA design debate for many shoulder and elbow surgeons

over the past decade has remained: medialized vs. lateral-ized designs. Our study provides a unique perspective as it was performed at an early-adopting center in the United States with shoulder reconstruction surgeons using both designs and no design-surgeon bias during the years of study. Despite some RTSA technique changes since early adoption, our medium- to long-term outcomes serve as a benchmark for future implant studies. With an overall reoperation rate of 6% and complication rate of 16% in patients with primary RTSA performed 10 to 14 years ago, survivorship of primary RTSA in the elderly patient with cuff tear arthropathy is encouraging.

  Bacle et al2 reported on the European long-term expe-rience using the Grammont-style prosthesis, with a 29% complication rate and 12% revision rate. They reported a 10-year overall prosthetic survival rate free of revision of 93%. Cuff et al8 recently reported on 42 primary RTSAs implanted using a design with glenoid lateralization. The 10-year overall survival rate free of revision was 90.7%, with maintained improvements in outcome scores and range of motion. Similarly to the findings of these 2 pre-vious long-term studies, our study demonstrated satisfac-tory clinical and radiographic outcomes with low reoperation and complication rates. Despite the limited number of survivors at long-term follow-up, it is

encouraging to note relatively low rates of complications and reoperations with no major differences between the 2 groups. No statistically significant differences in compli-cation or revision rates were found between the M group and GL group.


  Although the primary endpoint of this study was implant revision, we also performed a detailed radiographic review to identify evidence of implant loosening and scapular notching. An accepted criticism of the Grammont design is the high rate of scapular notching, although the effect this portends to functional outcome is debated. At long-term follow-up, Bacle et al2 reported a 73% rate of scapular notching; 61% of these cases were classified as Sirveaux stage 1 or 2 and the other 39%, as stage 3 or 4. The same study reported a 39% increase in the rate of scapular notching since medium-term follow-up. It is interesting to note that Bacle et al reported no statistically significant differences in long-term Constant scores between patients without notching or with a lower stage of scapular notching (0, 1, or 2) and patients with a higher stage of scapular notching (3 or 4).

  Other studies have reported rates of stage 3 or 4 notching using a Grammont-style RTSA as low as 17% and as high as 62%.16,18 In our study, in the M group, the overall notching rate was similar, at 77%, with severe notching (stage 3 or 4) present in 23% of the shoulders. The lower rate of severe notching in our cohort is likely attributable to the shorter follow-up time compared with the long-term study of Bacle et al2; it stands to reason that as time pro-gresses, notching rates will increase.

  One of the proposed benefits of glenoid lateralization is to minimize scapular notching rates. Cuff et al8 reported their long-term notching rate at a modest 15%, with grade 1 notching in patients except 1 patient with grade 2 notching. The radiographic follow-up period in their study was a mean of 68 months, with notching appearing at an average of 49 months. In our study, the GL group demon-strated higher rates of notching than in the aforementioned study. The overall notching rate was 46.9%, with 37.5% being grade 1 or 2. Severe notching (grade 3 or 4) was present in 9.4% of the shoulders in our GL group. These higher notching rates compared with previous reports may be attributable to variations in surgical technique related to implant position.

  Erickson et al11 conducted a systematic review evalu-ating range-of-motion differences in RTSA with 135 and 155 neck-shaft angle designs. Their review included 3434 shoulders with an average follow-up period of 3 years. The results showed significant improvements in external rota-tion, forward elevation, and abduction with both implants but showed significantly greater improvements in external rotation with the 135 prosthesis. Although the hypothesis of Erickson et al was similar to ours in that we both ex-pected no significant difference between the groups, the results differed. Our results showed no significant differ-ence in external rotation but a significant improvement in forward elevation with the 155 implant. There may be several reasons for these differences. Erickson et al included many different implants in their study and only focused on the neck-shaft angle, ignoring all other implant characteristics such as the center of rotation and amount of
  

lateralization of the glenoid and humerus; this approach yields a much more heterogeneous sample. Furthermore, nearly half of the studies reported an authorship conflict of interest; this is relevant when the range of motion is physician reported and could lead to a bias in range-of-motion reporting. Conversely, a strength of our study is that there was no conflict of interest and no implant designers reporting outcomes. Both studies conclude that patients see a significant improvement in range of motion with either implant design.

  Certainly, a strength of this study is the relatively high volume of primary RTSAs performed during the study period by shoulder reconstructive surgeons at a single institution. Both the medialized design and the glenoid-lateralized design were used based solely on surgeon preferences. In fact, several surgeons used both designs during the study period. It is important to note that the surgeons in this study were not design surgeons or con-sultants for either of the implants used during the study period, alleviating the inherent concern for selection bias in implant choice. To our knowledge, this is the only medium-to long-term follow-up study comparing RTSA outcomes and survivorship using both prosthesis designs at a single institution.

  This study has limitations that one must consider. First, the retrospective nature of the study lends itself to inherent recall and observer bias. Our clinical data were gathered from self-reported joint registry questionnaires as well as clinical examinations, leading to the concern for interob-server bias; moreover, patient-reported values may not correlate to a true standardized range-of-motion measure-ment by a health care provider. Another limitation of this study is the high mortality rate, with nearly 50% of patients having died before 10-year follow-up. Presumably, these patients died with a functional implant in place, but this cannot be confirmed. This study is also subject to selection bias as the primary surgeon had full discretion on implant selection during the study; there was no randomization between the implant designs. Similarly, the surgical tech-nique used in the early adoption years was not standardized and has nuanced differences from our current technique regarding implant placement and soft tissue tension. These aforementioned technical differences could prove to affect long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes in the future.

Conclusion

Primary RTSA using both an implant with a medialized glenoid and an inlay humeral component with a 155 polyethylene angle and an implant with a lateralized glenoid and a 135 polyethylene angle was associated with satisfactory clinical outcomes and a low reopera-tion rate in patients undergoing surgery more than 10 years ago. The 10-year cumulative incidences of

reoperations and complications were 5% to 8% and 14% to 20%, respectively. Aside from better active elevation in the M group, no substantial differences were found between the 2 implant styles in terms of clinical out-comes, complications, and reoperations. The M group had higher overall rates of notching, although differ-ences in rates of severe notching were not statistically significant between the 2 groups. Almost 50% of the patients who underwent the procedure died within 10 years with a presumed satisfactory implant in place. The results of this study can only be extrapolated to primary RTSA for cuff tear arthropathy, but they definitely pro-vide a benchmark for comparison with newer implants, especially considering that the procedures reported here do include the early learning curve for implantation of RTSA at our institution.

Shoulder Arthroplasty in Patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis:
Long-Term Outcomes


Running Title: Shoulder Arthroplasty in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis


Background: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatologic
3
disease that occurs in the pediatric population. Often, JIA continues throughout life leading to
4
progressive polyarticular arthritis and significant joint destruction and disability, oftentimes
5
requiring replacement surgery. This study aimed to determine the outcomes of primary shoulder
6
arthroplasty (SA) in patients with JIA.
7
Methods: Over a 42-year time period (1977 – 2019), 67 primary SA (20 hemiarthroplasty (HA),

proof
8
38 anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), and 9 reverse sh ulder arthroplasty (RSA)) with a
9
prior diagnosis of JIA formally established in a multi-disci lina y rheumatologic clinic met
10
inclusion criteria. Further assessment was perform d with inclusion    the visual analog scale

11 (VAS) pain score, active shoulder range of motion (ROM), imaging studies, complications, and

12 implant survivorship free from reoperation and revision.

13 Results: SA led to substantial improvements in pain and ROM across the entire cohort at an

14 average follow-up period of 12.2 years (range, 2– 34 years). TSA was associated with the lowest

15 pain scores (0.8; p = 0.02) and the highest ASES scores (77.4; p = 0.04) at most recent follow-up

16 when compared to HA and RSA. There were 14 (21%) complications across the cohort with

17 rotator cuff failure (n=4; 5.9%) as the most common complication followed by infection (n=3;

18 4.5%). Revision surgery was performed in 5 shoulders (7.5%), with five-year implant survival

19 rates of 95.1% at five years, 93% at ten years, 89.4% at twenty years, and 79.5% at thirty years.

20 At 30 years, TSA was associated with better survival (90.1%) when compared with HA (71.8%).

21 Conclusions: Primary shoulder arthroplasty in the form of HA, TSA, and RSA offers a reliable

22 surgical option for JIA patients with respect to pain reduction and ROM improvements. Unique

23 challenges still exist in this cohort, in particular younger patients with an elevated propensity for


glenoid bone erosion and a complication rate of 20.9%. As such, HA may not be ideal in this patient population. However, despite rotator cuff and glenoid concerns, TSA seems to be associated with better pain relief and patient reported outcomes with the most durability in the long term when compared to HA.

      Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in the pediatric population.14 JIA is a heterogeneous dis ase that is diagnosed when any form of

arthritis persists for 6 weeks or greater in a child of 16 years of age or younger and is of unknown etiology.14 TheJournal7differetsubtypes of JIA are classified according to the number of

joints affected, serology and ext ticular manifestations. Accounting for all categories, JIA occurs in approximately 1 in 1,000 children and is diagnosed via history and physical examination, with joint stiffness being the most specific presenting symptom.2 Even with advancements in medical management, joint replacement surgery represents the standard treatment for patients with recalcitrant pain and decreasing function secondary to progressive inflammatory joint degeneration.

      Patients with severe JIA and polyarticular involvement often undergo multiple joint replacement procedures, with the hip and knee being the most commonly and earliest affected joints. Consequently, most of the contemporary literature guiding orthopedic surgeons caring for patients with JIA is centered around the hip and knee.13 Pathology at the glenohumeral joint also

47 causes substantial disability, but often occurs later in the disease course with 15% of patients

48 being affected at 15 years.11

49	Despite the documented success of total hip arthroplasty (THA)3 and total knee

50 arthroplasty (TKA)12 in JIA, there remains paucity of information regarding the outcome of

51 shoulder arthroplasty (SA) in this unique patient cohort. Madanipour et al11 recently performed a

52 review of the available 4 studies reporting outcomes on 50 JIA patients receiving 58 shoulder

53 replacements, with 33 hemiarthroplasties (HA) and 25 anatomic total shoulder arthroplasties

54 (TSA).7,19 Overall, they demonstrated improvement in patient satisfacti  n and pain relief, but

55 also highlighted the need for additional investigations with la ger numbers, longer term data, and

56 less heterogeneity. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to review our outcomes following

57	primary SA performed in patients with JIA. The p	s nt investigation reports on (i) clinical

58 outcomes in terms of functional outcome measures and radiographic analysis, (ii) postoperative

59 complications, and (iii) implant survivorship free from reoperation and revision.


62 MATERIALS AND METHODS

63	Approval was first obtained from our Institutional Review Board (IRB) followed by data

64 acquisition from a prospectively recorded Institutional Total Joint Registry. This registry

65 prospectively captures data regarding complications, implant survival and patient-reported

66 outcomes using a standardized data collection form as described previously. Data collection

67 intervals include 1, 2, and 5 years postoperatively, and then every 5 years thereafter. For patients

68 unable to return physically, they are requested to complete and return a validated outcomes

69 questionnaire along with radiographs.17All adults who underwent a primary shoulder arthroplasty (n = 10,503) between January 1977 and December 2019 were identified. A subsequent review

71 identified all patients with a diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (n = 79), as defined as

72 only those patients formally diagnosed by team members of a multi-disciplinary rheumatologic

73 clinic. Patients with a concomitant diagnosis of malignancy (n = 1), treatment with a metal

74 backed glenoid component (n = 6), death secondary to unrelated events from index surgery (n =

75 2), or less than 2 years of clinical follow-up were excluded (n = 3). The final cohort consisted of

76 67 primary shoulder replacements (20 hemiarthroplasty (HA), 38 anatomic total shoulder

77 arthroplasty (TSA), and 9 reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA)).

78	Implant use for the entire cohort varied by surgeon. HA implants consisted of the Cofield

79 2 shoulder prosthesis in 11 shoulders (Smith & N ph w, Memphis, TN, USA), Neer II shoulder

80 prosthesis in 6 shoulders (3M Company, St Paul, MN, USA), and Bio-modular shoulder

81 prosthesis in 3 shoulders (Biomet, Warsaw, IN, USA). TSA consisted of the Cofield 2 anatomic

82 prosthesis in 16 shoulders (Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN, USA), Neer II anatomic prosthesis

83 in 12 shoulders (3M Company, St Paul, MN, USA), Comprehensive anatomic prosthesis in 4

84 patients (Biomet, Warsaw, IN, USA), Aequalis anatomic shoulder prosthesis in 3 patients

85 (Tornier/Viking, Montbonnot, France), ReUnion anatomic shoulder prosthesis in 2 patients

86 (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA), and Bigliani/Flatow shoulder prosthesis in 1 patient (Zimmer,

87 Warsaw, IN, USA). RSA implants consisted of the Comprehensive reverse prosthesis in 6

88 patients (Biomet, Warsaw, IN, USA), ReUnion reverse prosthesis in 2 patients (Stryker,

89 Kalamazoo, MI, USA), and Aequalis reverse prosthesis in 1 patient (Tornier/Viking,

90 Montbonnot, France).

91	Operative intervention was completed by 1 of 8 upper extremity surgeons at a single

92 institution. Indications for surgery was symptomatic glenohumeral arthritis refractory to

nonoperative treatment. The decision between implantation of various shoulder arthroplasty techniques (HA, TSA, RSA) was determined by the treating surgeon based on a combination of physical exam, rotator cuff status, and glenoid bone loss. RSA was not available for use until 2004, and as such all arthroplasties performed prior to that year were either HA (n = 17, 25.4%) or TSA (n = 19, 28.4%). After 2004, only 4 (6.0%) HA were performed but TSA use persisted with another 19 (28.4%) replacements. A standard deltopectoral approach was uniformly utilized. Glenoid bone grafting was performed in 2 shoulders (3%) with morselized cancellous graft in 1 TSA and structural graft in 1 TSA; of note, the structural graft was performed before RSA was available to the institution. Humeral bone grafting was performed in the remaining 4 shoulders (6%) with morselized cancellous autograft in 2 HA and 2 TSA. Additional procedures at the time of hemiarthroplasty were performed in 4 (6%) shoulders. These consisted of 3 rotator cuff repairs (2 TSA and 1 HA) and 1 lysis of adhesions in a HA.

      A concurrent reviewJournalofistitutional Total Joint Registry Database as well as electronic medical record review was completed to obtain pre- and postoperative 10-point visual

analog pain scale scores, active range of motion measurements assessed in 3 planes (forward elevation, external rotation, and internal rotation), strength in 3 planes, and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES) score. Forward elevation and external rotation were measured in degrees, internal rotation was measured by the level reached by the thumb according to the scale by Flurin et al5. Additional clinical outcomes of interest included postoperative complications, and implant survivorship free from reoperations or revision surgery (revision being defined as subsequent removal and/or exchange of any components). JIA in SA
116
Pre- and postoperative imaging was independently reviewed by two surgeons (E.M.M
117
and B.S.S) in order to analyze the preoperative glenohumeral morphology and postoperative
118
implant changes. Preoperative severity of arthritis was determined by the Larsen et al
119
classification.9 When applicable, postoperative humeral head subluxation was classified
120
according to direction and graded mild, moderate, or severe according to the Torchia et al
121
classification.20 Postoperative glenoid erosion after HA was graded according to the method
122
proposed by Sperling et al.18 Postoperative radiolucencies    the glenoid and humeral component

proof
123
were graded according to Lazarus et al10 and Sanchez-Sotelo et al,15 respectively. For RSA,
124
scapular notching was graded according to the Nerot-Sirveaux g ading system.22
125
Data was statistically analyzed using JMP 14.1.0 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC,

126 USA). Continuous variables were reported as m ans with ranges. Group means were compared

127 utilizing student’s t-tests. Categorical variab es were analyzed using the ?2 test, or the Fisher

128 exact test given low counts of some comp risons. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated

129 to determine survivorship free f om  eoperation and revision. For all data points, statistical

130 significance was considered to be achieved when the p value was less than 0.05.

133 RESULTS

134	A total of 67 primary shoulder SA (20 HA, 38 TSA, 9 RSA) met inclusion criteria. There

135 were 58 females (86.6%) and 9 males (13.4%) with a mean age of 42.2 ± 15.6 and BMI of 26.0 ±

136 6.5 at the time of surgery. Pertinent co-morbidities included chronic steroid use in 20 (29.9%)

137 patients, treatment with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) in 14 (20.9%)

138 patients, and prior surgery in 4 (6%) patients. Notable differences between implant groups (HA




vs. TSA vs. RSA) included a younger age of surgery in HA (39 vs. 40.5 vs. 56.6; p = 0.001), shortest time between JIA diagnosis and surgery in HA (29.3 vs. 31.7 vs. 45.9; p = 0.02), and longest follow-up in HA (16.9 vs. 11.7 vs. 3.7; p =0.002). Additional, baseline demographic characteristics are detailed in Table 1.

Functional Outcomes

      At a mean follow-up of 12.2 years (range, 2 to 34 years), shoulder arthroplasty in patients with JIA demonstrated improvements in pain (8.0 to 1.1; P < 0.001), orward elevation (85.8? to 123.0?; P < 0.001), external rotation (23.8? to 42.5?; P < 0.01) and internal rotation (2.9 to 4.4; P = 0.03) (Table 2). At final follow-up the mean VAS was 1.1 ± 0.9 and the mean ASES score was 75.2 ± 9.4. When analyzed according to implant style, ostoperative pain was the lowest after TSA (0.8 ± 0.3), followed by HA (1.4 ± 0.4), and RSA (2.7 ± 0.6, p = 0.02). Further pairwise

comparisons demonstratedJournalsignificantdifference in favor of TSA over RSA p = 0.02). Postoperative ASES was the highest fter TSA (77.4 ± 3.5), followed by RSA (77.0 ± 1.5), and

HA (70.8 ± 2.1, p = 0.04). Additional pairwise comparisons demonstrated a significant difference between TSA and HA (p = 0.04). With the numbers available, no implant differences were observed in forward elevation (P = 0.71), external rotation (P = 0.77), internal rotation (P = 0.71), forward elevation strength (P = 0.47), external rotation strength (P = 0.51), or internal rotation strength (P = 0.66) (Table 3).

Radiographic Analysis

      A total of 54 shoulders (80.6%) had preoperative imaging available. Glenohumeral joint changes were classified via the Larsen classification as grade III in 3, grade IV in 34, grade V in 16 shoulders. At the time of most recent follow-up, 58 of 67 shoulders (86.6%) had a complete postoperative Grashey and axillary film series allowing for review. Across all HA and TSA,


162 humeral head subluxation was observed in 25 of 49 shoulders (51%), most commonly with a

163 superior direction (n = 22). Radiolucent lines across all implant humeral stems were observed in

164 12 of 58 shoulders (20.7%), most commonly at zone 1 (n = 9).

165	Of the 16 HA available for review, glenoid erosion was present in 15 shoulders (93.7%):

166 mild in 3, moderate in 6, and severe in 6. Humeral head subluxation was observed in 10 of 16

167 shoulders (62.5%): 9 superior (mild = 4, moderate = 1, severe = 4) and 1 anterior. Humeral

168 periprosthetic radiolucency was observed in 1 shoulder (6.3%) at zone 8. Of the 33 TSA

169 available for review, 16 (48%) shoulders demonstrated radi lucencies about the glenoid

170 component with a mean grade of 1.3. The Lazarus score was g ade 0 in 13 shoulders, grade 1 in

171 4, grade 2 in 3, grade 4 in 3, and grade 5 in 4. Hum ral head subluxation was observed in 15 of

172	33 shoulders (45.5%): 13 superior (mild = 4, mod	ate = 4, severe = 5) and 2 anterior. Humeral

173 sided lucencies were observed in 10 of 33 (30.3%) shoulders: 7 in zone 1, 4 in zone 7, 1 in zone

174 8. All 9 RSA were available for review; sc pular notching was noted in 2 of 9 shoulders (22.2%)

175 at a severity of grade 1 for both shoulders. Humeral periprosthetic radiolucency was observed in

176 1 of 9 (11%) shoulders at z  ne 1.

177 Complications

178	Perioperative complications were found in 14 (20.9%) of the shoulders, with rotator cuff

179 failure (n=4; 5.9%) as the most common complication, followed by infection (n=3; 4.5%),

180 aseptic component loosening (n=2; 3%), and nerve palsy / neuropathy (n=2; 3%). A subanalysis

181 was performed comparing the various complication profiles by implant type (Table 4). There

182 were 4 of 20 (20.0%) HA complications of which the most common was rotator cuff failure (n =

183 2; 10%). There were 8 of 38 (21.1%) TSA complications of which the most common was rotator

184 cuff failure (n = 2; 5.3%), infection (n = 2; 5.3%), and nerve palsy / neuropathy (n = 2; 5.3%).


185 There were 2 of 9 (22.2%) RSA complications consisting of 1 (11.1%) aseptic humeral

186 component loosening and 1 (11.1%) scapular spine fracture.

187 Survivorship free from Reoperation, and Revision

188	Reoperations were all in the form of revisions and occurred in 5 shoulders (7.5%), which

189 consisted of a conversion to a HA for glenoid baseplate loosening in a TSA (1), conversion to a

190 RSA for progressive glenoid arthrosis in a HA (1), revision RSA for humeral component

191 loosening (1), conversion to RSA for instability in a TSA (1), and component removal and

192 antibiotic spacer placement for deep infection in a TSA (1). Overall survival from reoperation /

193 revision was found to be 97.0% at two years, 95.1% at five yea s, 93.0% at ten years, 89.4% at

194 twenty years, and 79.5% at thirty years (Fig. 1). Wh n compared across implants the five-year

195 survival rates were 89.7%, 100%, and 88.9% for HA, TSA, and RSA respectively (p = 0.22).

196 After five years, only HA and TSA had avai able survivorship data with subsequent survival of

197 89.7% and 96.5% at ten years, 89.7%   d 90.1% at twenty years, and 71.8% and 90.1% at 30

198 years (Figure 1).

200 DISCUSSION

201	JIA represents a chronic rheumatologic disease that occurs in the pediatric population and

202 often continues to progress throughout life, leading to progressive polyarticular arthritis,

203 substantial joint destruction, and disability.2 Pathology at the glenohumeral joint causes disability

204 but often occurs later in the disease course, with 15% of patients being affected at 15 years.11

205 Although shoulder JIA causes substantial reductions in quality of life and can severely interfere

206 with activities of daily living, there continues to be limited outcome data in the contemporary

207 literature to direct shoulder surgeons in the management of this population. In our reported



cohort of 67 primary SA in patients with juvenile inflammatory arthritis, excellent clinical outcomes were shown, with significant improvements in pain, forward elevation, external rotation, and internal rotation. Complications did occur in 20% of patients, with implant survivorship of 80% at 30 years.

      This study represents one of the largest series to report exclusively on primary SA in patients with JIA. Of the few published studies available, there are reports of improved pain relief and functional scores following SA in JIA.7,8,11,19 In 2005, Thomas et al reported on nine HAs with systemic or polyarticular JIA observing excellent pain relief and improvements in the Constant-Murley Score (CMS) at a mean follow-up of six yea s. Functional improvements were also noted to deteriorate over time in their cohort which was attributed to the progression of the systemic disease.19 Later in 2018, Ibrahim et al po t d on 14 resurfacing HAs with a mean

follow-up of 10.4 years. They also reported excellent pain relief with 8 of 14 shoulders pain free, and the remainder reportingJournalonlymildpin and final follow-up. The CMS and Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) were utilized to measu e function. Six shoulders had a very good or excellent

outcome and 8 shoulders had good or fair outcome on CMS.7 Jolles et al reported on 13 patients with severe polyarticular JIA treated with SA (12 HA, 1 TSA) with 9-year follow-up. Pain significantly decreased following surgery by a mean of 6.7 using the VAS. They reported significant improvements in both forward elevation and external rotation but final SF-36 and DASH results were poor.8 The results of the present study are comparable to past studies that SA in JIA can lead to reliable decreases in pain and satisfactory functional improvements. One unique aspect of the current investigation is comparisons across various implants with TSA demonstrating the most significant improvement in final postoperative pain (0.8) and ASES score (77.4) as compared to HA and RSA.
231	Patients with inflammatory arthritis and JIA present the treating surgeon with several

232 unique challenges in executing the replacement. Immunosuppressing medications, rotator cuff

233 disease, severe glenoid erosion and osteopenia are common characteristics in this patient

234 population that can lead to elevated complication rates. In the Madanipour et al 11 review of the

235 JIA literature to date, a 17% pooled complication rate was observed across all 4 studies

236 reviewed. These complications included 3 intraoperative humeral fractures (2 HA and 1 TSA)

237 that did not require additional fixation and 1 axillary nerve palsy (HA) that resolved over time in

238 the Jolles et al cohort8. Deshmukh et al observed 1 TSA disl  cati  n in p st op day 1 that was

239 treated with closed reduction and 1 TSA prosthetic joint infecti  n 10.4 years following the index

240 procedure.4 Thomas et al observed 1 open excision of the acromioclavicular joint for ACJ

241 arthritis and 1 persistent lateral forearm paraesth sias in HA.19  Finally, Ibrahim et al observed 2

242 patients with subsequent subacromial impingement requiring arthroscopic subacromial

243 decompression at 6 months after resurf cing HA. The present cohort observed a comparable but

244 elevated complication rate of 21%, of which rotator cuff failure (6%) was the most common.

245 This may partially be explained by the extended follow-up in this study (mean 12 years). With

246 time, rotator cuff disease can be expected to progress, with rotator cuff tearing having been

247 shown to increase over time following TSA.16,21 This highlights the importance of careful soft

248 tissue balancing during TSA implantation in order to mitigate the likelihood of late rotator cuff

249 failure and promote prosthesis longevity. Additionally, it is important to note that intra-operative

250 fractures were not observed in this cohort despite the elevated concern from previous

251 investigations.

252	In comparison to rheumatoid arthritis, patients with JIA often experience prolonged

253 periods of disease duration before arthroplasty, with joint replacement surgery commonly being

254 completed at a relatively young age.13 In the limited JIA shoulder arthroplasty literature, mean

255 age at time of arthroplasty has been reported at 32, 33.1, 36.4 and 60.3 years of age in the

256 Thomas et al 19, Jolles et al 8,Ibrahim et al 7, and Deshmukh et al4 investigations respectively.

257 Comparing with the rheumatoid literature, Barlow et al performed a similar investigation

258 reporting on 303 consecutive shoulder arthroplasties (108 HA, 195 TSA) in rheumatoid arthritis

259 with a minimum 5-year follow-up.1 In this cohort the average age was 55 years, approximately

260 13 years older than the JIA cohort. Interestingly, they observed a 9% overall complication rate

261 with 19 (9.7%) complications in the TSA group with and 9 (8.3%) c mplications in the HA

262 group. In the TSA cohort, 10 (6.1%) nerve injuries, 4 (2.4%) int a perative fractures, 3 (1.8%)

263 wound problems, 1 (0.6%) postoperative humeral shaft fracture, and 1 (0.6%) deltoid tear

264 requiring intraoperative repair were observed. The HA group had 5 (5.5%) intraoperative

265 fractures, 3 (3.3%) nerve injuries, and 1 (1.1%) wound problem.1 Recent systematic review on

266	TSA in rheumatoid arthritis by Haleem et	l also observed an older aged cohort with a mean of

267 68 years and a lower complication  ate of 9% compared to the present JIA study. 6 The present

268 cohort received an arthr  plasty procedure at an average of 42 years, with a mean of 33 years

269 from JIA diagnosis to surgery. Furthermore, this group of JIA patients experienced a 21%

270 complication rate. These findings support the evidence that JIA often results in a younger age at

271 the time of arthroplasty, and a higher complication rate especially when compared to rheumatoid

272 arthritis.

273	Despite the elevated complication rate in the present cohort, SA demonstrated excellent

274 mid-term and good long-term survivorship in this patient population. Overall survival from

275 reoperation / revision was found to be 95.1% at five years, 93.0% at ten years, 89.4% at twenty

276 years, and 79.5% at thirty years. When compared across implants the five-year survival rates



were the highest with TSA at 100% followed by 89.7% for HA, and 88.9% for RSA. At final follow-up, TSA still had the best survivorship with 90.1% at 30 years, with HA now having the lowest survival with 71.8% at 34 years. Part of this discrepancy likely represents progression of inflammatory arthritis and development of painful glenoid erosion, which is alleviated by placement of a glenoid component. In further review of the current published JIA literature, mainly mid-term data is available. Interestingly, 3 of the 4 studies Thomas et al 19, Jolles et al8, and Ibrahim et al 7 demonstrated 100% survivorship free from revision in their cohorts with a mean follow-up of 6, 9, and 10 years, respectively. These excellent early results are similar to our cohort; however, the present investigation notes that as time c ntinues approximately 20% of patients will sustain some form of failure across all im lant ty es.

The present investigation was not without limitations. Foremost, this was a retrospective

analysis of a prospectively collected registry data. Additionally, less than 1% of the shoulder
replacements performedJournalatistitutionduring the study period were performed on patients



with JIA, resulting in relatively small sample size. There was no formal control group to which the JIA cohort could be c mpared. Furthermore, the implant groups were not matched for the preoperative degree of glenohumeral arthritis, subluxation, or presence of associated rotator cuff injuries. This may limit some of the direct comparisons across the various prosthesis. Additionally, patients with JIA were treated by one of 8 staff surgeons at our institution who may have slight variations in surgical techniques. To assess this we presented the principles behind surgical decision making, the ultimate implants utilized, and all available intra-operative findings. Finally, the available dataset did not include any detailed perioperative information about the medical management of JIA, its comorbid conditions, and whether patients were adherent to any possible medical treatment recommendations. As such, there may be some

300 underlying bias based on when patients were diagnosed and the available treatment options at

301 that time.

302

303 CONCLUSION

304	Primary shoulder arthroplasty in the form of HA, TSA, and RSA offers a reliable surgical

305 option for JIA patients with respect to pain reduction and ROM improvements. Unique

306 challenges still exist in this cohort, younger patients with an elevated propensity for glenoid bone

307 erosion and a complication rate of 20.9%. As such, HA may n t be ideal in this patient

308 population. However, despite rotator cuff and glenoid conce ns, TSA seems to be associated with

309 better pain relief and patient reported outcomes with the most durability in the long term when

310 compared to HA.










Shoulder Periprosthetic Joint Infection and All-Cause Mortality: A Worrisome Association

Investigation performed at the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota



Background: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) can be a devastating complication following shoulder arthroplasty. PJI following hip and knee arthroplasties has been found to increase mortality. However, anatomical and bacteriologic differences could potentially result in a different trend after shoulder arthroplasties. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to determine whether there is an association between shoulder PJI and all-cause mortality.

Methods: Our institutional Total Joint Registry Database was queried to identify patients who underwent revision shoulder arthroplasty procedures between 2000 and 2018. A total of 1,160 procedures were then classified as either septic (21.8%) or aseptic (78.2%). Septic revisions were further subdivided into (1) debridement, antibiotics, irrigation, and implant retention (9.1%); (2) 2-stage reimplantation for deep infection (61.3%); (3) implant resection without reim-

plantation (3.6%); and (4) unexpected positive cultures at revision surgery (26.1%). The most common bacterium isolated was Cutibacterium acnes (64.4%). All-cause patient mortality was determined with use of our registry and confirmed with

use of a nationwide mortality database. All-cause crude and adjusted mortality rates were then compared between groups.

Results: The 1-year crude mortality rate was 1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9% to 2.6%) for the aseptic group and 2.8% (95% CI, 0.7% to 4.8%) for the septic group (p = 0.31). Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated an elevated but statistically similar adjusted hazard ratio for 1-year all-cause mortality of 1.9 (95% CI, 0.8 to 4.6) when comparing the septic to the aseptic group (p = 0.17). The risk of 2-year all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the

septic group, with a hazard ratio of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.1 to 4.5; p = 0.029). In univariate analyses, increased 5-year mortality in the septic revision group was associated with age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, whereas C. acnes infection was associated with lower mortality.

Conclusions: Shoulder PJI is associated with an adjusted 2-year all-cause mortality rate that is double that of aseptic patients. The results of the present study should be utilized to appropriately counsel patients who are considered to be at risk for infection following shoulder arthroplasty.

Level of Evidence: Prognostic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

the utilization of primary shoulder arthroplasty in the TUnited States has increased dramatically over the last 2 decades and is projected to continue rising1-3. The incidence of shoulder periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) can be anticipated

to rise accordingly4, as this complication is observed in approxi-mately 1% of patients4-7. Shoulder PJI has been associated with a number of factors including male sex, younger age, and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty4,5,7,8, although the impact of medical comor-bidities remains controversial4-9. The economic costs associated with 2-stage reimplantation for shoulder PJI are substantial4,10, not to mention the considerable impact on the quality of life of patients.



     The typical 2-stage reimplantation treatment algorithm for shoulder PJI requires 2 revision arthroplasty procedures and long-term intravenous antibiotics10. Although the short-term mortality rate following primary total shoulder arthroplasty has been reported to range between 0.16% and 1.5% at 90 days11-13 and up to 3.8% at 1 year12,13, rates as high as 3% have been reported at 90 days fol-lowing revision shoulder arthroplasty in older patients14. Factors associated with mortality have included male sex and increased age15, but the direct impact of shoulder PJI on mortality is unknown.

     The lower-extremity arthroplasty literature provides strong evidence that hip and knee PJI are associated with a 1.8 to 5-fold increase in the odds of 1-year mortality16,17. However, this relationship has not been studied for shoulder PJI, in which anatomic and bacteriologic5,7,16 differences may translate into different mortality rates. The purpose of the present study was to compare all-cause mortality rates between patients who underwent a surgical procedure for shoulder PJI and those who underwent a revision for aseptic failure. Further, for patients with a shoulder PJI, we sought to determine patient and infection characteristics associated with mortality. We hypothesized that PJI would increase mortality in patients undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty.


Materials and Methods

Patient Cohort
All revision shoulder arthroplasty procedures completed between 2000 and 2018 within a multi-hospital single academic health system were retrospectively identified from our  prospectively collected Total Joint Registry Database, yielding a total of 1,177 procedures. Patients were excluded if their arthroplasty was part of an oncologic reconstruction (11 patients), they had an antibiotic spacer for >1 year prior to reimplantation (5 patients), or records from referring hospitals were not available to classify them (1 patient). During this time period, 6,716 primary shoulder arthroplasty procedures were
completed at our institution, highlighting that revision arthro-plasty accounts for 17% of procedures within our system. All living patients had at least 2 years of postoperative follow-up, with follow-up periods of <2 years representing deaths (average follow-up, 4.4 years; range, 3 days to 5 years). Aseptic revision procedures included all surgeries that involved exchange or replacement of any prosthetic component, without suspicion or postoperative treatment for infection.

     A procedure was classified as septic if the patient was presumed to have a PJI on the basis of preoperative or intra-operative findings and was treated with antibiotics for a PJI postoperatively by the orthopaedic surgeon and consulting infectious disease specialist. Septic procedures were further grouped as (1) debridement, antibiotics, irrigation, and im-plant retention (DAIR); (2) 2-stage explant and delayed re-implantation with a temporary antibiotic spacer; (3) implant resection without reimplantation; or (4) unexpected positive cultures at revision surgery. Patients initially treated with DAIR but then treated with a 2-stage explantation procedure within the following year were classified as having a 2-stage revision. Additionally, patients in the unexpected positive cultures group were only included in the septic cohort if they were treated postoperatively for suspected deep infection with long-term antibiotics by our infectious disease physicians. Patients who underwent multiple revisions within the 19-year collection window were grouped into either the aseptic or septic cohort according to the classification of their first revision within the period.

     Altogether, a total of 1,160 revision shoulder arthroplasty procedures were included within the analysis, with 907 (78.2%) of those being classified as aseptic and 253 (21.8%) as septic (Table I). Of those in the septic group, 155 (61.3%) un-derwent a 2-stage exchange, 66 (26.1%) had unexpected pos-itive cultures, 23 (9.1%) were treated with DAIR, and 9 (3.6%) had an implant resection. In the septic cohort, 85.4% of patients were found to have at least 1 positive culture. Cuti-bacterium acnes was the most common bacterium and was observed in 64.4% of infected shoulders, whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci were the second most common bacteria and were cultured in 23.6% of infections (Table II). Poly-microbial infections constituting more than 1 bacterium other than C. acnes were rare (n = 12, 5.6%).

Mortality

Patient survival and all-cause mortality events were captured through routine contacts by the registry, and confirmed when needed with use of a nationwide mortality database (Accurint by LexisNexis). When utilizing the nationwide database, a 6-month lag period was included in order to ensure that all deaths were given an appropriate interlude to be recorded accurately, similar to the methodology in previous studies16. Time-to-death calculations were performed according to the first revision surgery for patients in the aseptic, DAIR, resec-tion, and unexpected culture groups. For patients in the 2-stage septic group, the date of reimplantation was utilized as the start of their timeline, as this was the point at which they were
routinely captured by our Total Joint Registry Database. Utili-zation of the explantation date as the start of the mortality timeline in 2-stage patients was avoided because it could lead to an immortal time bias whereby patients were inaccurately attributed extra survival time prior to enrollment, since by definition all subjects must have survived that time period in order to be captured by the registry18. Baseline patient demo-graphics, severity- and age-weighted Charlson Comorbidity Index, and infection characteristics were extracted from our registry and by chart review.

Statistical Analysis

Kaplan-Meier analyses were utilized to compare overall survi-vorship between groups of interest with up to 5 years of follow-up and to report mortality rates at 90 days, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years post-revision. The log-rank test was utilized to determine if observed crude mortality rates were significantly different between cohorts within these analyses. In order to understand the independent association of shoulder PJI with mortality, Cox logistic regression was utilized in order to build multivari-able models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, and severity-and age-weighted Charlson Comorbidity Index when possible, with the number of adjusters dependent on the number of mortality events within the period of interest. Finally, possible associations between patient and infection characteristics with mortality following shoulder PJI were assessed with use of uni-variate Cox regression with variables of interest. In all analyses, significance was set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were per-formed with use of SAS (version 9.4M6; SAS Institute) and R (version 3.6.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

Results

The baseline patient demographics were significantly dif-ferent between the cohorts (Table I). The septic cohort had a significantly lower mean age at the time of surgery (62 years) and a significantly greater proportion of male patients (68%) compared with the aseptic cohort (67 years and 43%; p

< 0.001 for both comparisons). The severity- and age-weighted Charlson Comorbidity Index was significantly lower in the septic group. The ASA score, body mass index, and smoking status did not differ significantly between the cohorts.

     A total of 26 of 253 patients in the septic cohort and 92 of 907 patients in the aseptic cohort had died at the time of the latest follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves produced an estimated 1-year mortality rate of 2.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7% to 4.8%) in the septic cohort and 1.8% (95% CI, 0.9% to

2.6%) in the aseptic cohort; these crude rates were not signif-icantly different (p = 0.31) (Table III, Fig. 1). The log-rank test did not demonstrate any significant differences between the unadjusted crude mortality rates of the groups at any point.

     Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated an elevated but statistically similar adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for 1-year all-cause mortality of 1.89 (95% CI, 0.77 to 4.62) for the septic compared with the aseptic cohort (p = 0.17) (Table IV). The 2-year risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the septic group, with an HR of 2.21 (95% CI, 1.09 to 4.47; p = 0.029). At 5 years, the risk of all-cause mortality remained higher in the septic group (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.93 to 2.32), although this trend did not reach significance (p = 0.10). When eliminating patients with unexpected positive cultures from the analysis, the overall results were similar except that all-cause mortality re-mained significantly higher in the septic group at 5 years.

     In the septic cohort, univariate Cox regression analysis did not find any associations between all-cause mortality at 1, 2, or 5 years and sex, body mass index, or Gram-negative infec-tion (see Appendix 1). As expected, patient age was associ-ated with mortality at 2 and 5 years, whereas the Charlson Comorbidity Index were associated with increased mortality at all time intervals. Notably, infections with C. acnes only were associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality at 2 years (HR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.83; p = 0.033) and at 5 years (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.77; p = 0.012) (Table V). A methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection was associ-ated with a significantly increased risk of mortality at all time points (HR, 9.62; 95% CI, 1.87 to 49.6; p = 0.007 at 1 year). There was a trend toward a higher 2-year mortality rate in patients with polymicrobial infection, although this did not reach significance (p = 0.076). Mortality rates differed between procedure types in the septic group and were highest among patients who underwent resection (Fig. 2).

Discussion

As the number of shoulder arthroplasty procedures con-tinues to grow1-3, it is important to understand the potential adverse effect of shoulder PJI because the prevalence Kaplan-Meier 5-year survivorship curves for the septic and aseptic cohorts. These unadjusted rates demonstrate the trend toward increased all-cause mortality in the septic cohort, although the crude rates were statistically similar (p > 0.05).
of this complication will certainly increase accordingly4. The results of the present study indicate that, after adjusting for baseline differences between cohorts, patients undergoing re-vision arthroplasty for shoulder PJI are more than twice as
likely to die within 2 years of surgery compared with those undergoing an aseptic revision. These findings confirm our hypothesis that shoulder PJI is associated with increased mor-tality risk. Further, not all shoulder PJIs have an equal impact on patients, as MRSA infections were associated with a mortality risk that was 9.6 times greater than that for other infections, and isolated C. acnes infections were associated with a mortality risk that was 0.1 times that for other organisms.

     The lower-extremity arthroplasty literature has previously shown significantly higher mortality rates among patient with hip and knee PJI16,17. An institutional registry study observed an adjusted odds ratio for 1-year mortality of 5.9 in patients under-going septic versus aseptic revision lower-extremity arthroplasty. Additionally, a study from the Danish Joint Registry observed an adjusted odds ratio for mortality of 1.87 in patients undergoing revision total hip arthroplasty for PJI17. We chose to utilize Cox regression and hazard ratios in our study in order to better eval-uate the changes in mortality rate over time19, making it impossible to directly compare the magnitudes of effects between studies. However, the results of the present study agree with the overall trend that PJI is associated with increased all-cause mortality.

     The previous 2 studies from the lower-extremity arthro-plasty literature demonstrated significantly increased mortality rates in the septic cohorts within 1 year of revision surgery, whereas the present study showed no significant difference until 2


years postoperatively. It is impossible to know if this discrepancy represents a true underlying difference between lower and upper-extremity PJI because the discrepancy could be explained by the smaller sample sizes of the present cohorts and the overall scarcity of mortality events, and because there was a nonsignificant but elevated rate of 1-year all-cause mortality in the septic cohort (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 0.77 to 4.62; p = 0.17). However, 1 prior study found that the elevated mortality rates in the septic cohort were limited to the first postoperative year and disappeared beyond that time frame16, whereas our observations became stronger between 1 and 2 years. These differences could be a result of the different analytic methods utilized in the present study or could highlight that shoulder PJI carries an increased risk of mortality that is smaller in magnitude but more extended in duration.

     Interestingly, the previously observed 1-year mortality rates for aseptic revision total hip arthroplasty (5%; 95% CI, 4% to 6%) and septic revision total hip arthroplasty (8%; 95% CI, 6% to 11%)17 were substantially higher than those observed at 1 year in the present study (septic cohort: 2.8%; 95% CI, 0.7% to 4.8%; aseptic cohort: 1.8%; 95% CI, 0.9% to 2.6%). This difference highlights the greater toll associated with revision total hip arthroplasty, which is likely a result of the larger magnitude of the revision procedure; notably, the prior study highlighted that even patients undergoing aseptic revi-sion total hip arthroplasty had higher 1-year mortality than those who did not require revision17. In contrast, the present study showed revision shoulder arthroplasty mortality rates that were similar to the previously reported 1-year mortality rates of 2% to 3.8% following primary shoulder arthro-plasty12,13. Notably, the previously reported 5-year mortality rate following lower-extremity revision arthroplasty for PJI (26.1%) was substantially higher than that observed in our shoulder PJI cohort (11.5%)16, suggesting that lower-extremity PJI may have an overall greater impact on mortality.

     In the present study, patients with an MRSA infection had a substantially elevated risk of mortality (HR, 9.62). This elevated risk may be a result of the increased renal failure, hemodynamic instability, and mortality associated with MRSA versus methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) bacteremia in critically ill patients20. In contrast, a prior study did not find a higher risk of mortality with S. aureus, although these authors did not separate patients into MSSA and MRSA subgroups17. Zmistowski et al. also did not find increased mortality rates with MRSA, but instead found polymicrobial infections to be associated with mortality16. In the present study, polymicrobial infections constituting multiple flora other than C. acnes were rare (5.6%, n = 12) but also trended toward an increased 2-year mortality rate (HR, 3.96; p = 0.076). The present results were notable for the dramatically lower mortality rates in patients with isolated C. acnes infections, an organism less prevalent in previous lower-extremity studies and thus not specifically ana-lyzed previously. The unique flora in and contribution of C. acnes to shoulder PJI have long been known5,7,16, but these results provide additional evidence that C. acnes represents a funda-mentally different infection. Although shoulder PJI secondary to C. acnes can certainly cause pain and morbidity associated with implant failure, it does not appear to bring with it the increased mortality risk seen with other infections. Increased age and comorbidity scores were both associated with increased mor-tality following shoulder PJI, consistent with previous literature reporting similar associations with mortality following primary shoulder arthroplasty12,15,21.

     The strengths of the present study include the use of all revision shoulder arthroplasty procedures of interest over a 19-year period, giving us the scale necessary to evaluate mortality. However, even with this large scope, our analyses were limited by the rare nature of death following revision shoulder arthroplasty in general. We did not complete a formal power analysis because we planned to use all available patients, and it is possible that aspects of the analysis could be underpowered. This under-powering could have impacted several analyses, such as 1-year mortality, for which the number of deaths was still relatively low, making it possible to accept the null hypothesis inappropriately. Additional limitations of this study include defining patients in the septic group according to how they were treated by the infectious disease and orthopaedic surgery teams at the time, instead of by utilizing a formally defined criterion. Although the Musculoskeletal Infection Society22 framework has proved im-portant for lower-extremity infections, these criteria do not apply to the unique characteristics and flora of shoulder PJI and are not routinely utilized there. Instead, we ultimately relied on the decision-making of the teams treating the patients at the time of surgery to group them into the septic and aseptic cohorts. If anything, the inclusion of some patients in the septic cohort who were not truly infected would underestimate the impact of shoulder PJI on mortality. An additional limitation was our inability to complete subgroup analyses of patients on the basis of the type of implant they had prior to revision, as implant type can affect the relative invasiveness of the revision procedure. Addi-tionally, our 2 cohorts did have baseline differences, and although we worked to adjust for these with regression analysis, a study methodology relying on matching patients would have minimized this discrepancy. A final limitation is the retrospective nature of the study, which could have led to unanticipated selection bias.

Conclusions

Shoulder PJI was associated with an increased adjusted 2-year all-cause mortality rate, which was particularly magnified in patients with MRSA infections. This information can be helpful for counseling patients considered at risk for infection and when discussing the prognosis with patients with a shoulder PJI. Additional studies are needed to further understand the mech-anisms associated with increased mortality and shoulder PJI so that new interventions can be developed to mitigate this risk.
