JIA in SA1Abstract:2Background: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatologic3disease that occurs in the pediatric population. Often, JIA continues throughout life leading to4progressive polyarticular arthritis and significant joint destruction and disability, oftentimes5requiring replacement surgery. This study aimed to determine the outcomes of primary shoulder6arthroplasty (SA) in patients with JIA.7Methods: Over a 42-year time period (1977 – 2019), 67 primary SA (20 hemiarthroplasty (HA),proof838 anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), and 9 reverse sh ulder arthroplasty (RSA)) with a9prior diagnosis of JIA formally established in a multi-disci lina y rheumatologic clinic met10inclusion criteria. Further assessment was perform d with inclusion    the visual analog scale11 (VAS) pain score, active shoulder range of motion (ROM), imaging studies, complications, and12 implant survivorship free from reoperation and revision.13 Results: SA led to substantial improvements in pain and ROM across the entire cohort at an14 average follow-up period of 12.2 years (range, 2– 34 years). TSA was associated with the lowest15 pain scores (0.8; p = 0.02) and the highest ASES scores (77.4; p = 0.04) at most recent follow-up16 when compared to HA and RSA. There were 14 (21%) complications across the cohort with17 rotator cuff failure (n=4; 5.9%) as the most common complication followed by infection (n=3;18 4.5%). Revision surgery was performed in 5 shoulders (7.5%), with five-year implant survival19 rates of 95.1% at five years, 93% at ten years, 89.4% at twenty years, and 79.5% at thirty years.20 At 30 years, TSA was associated with better survival (90.1%) when compared with HA (71.8%).21 Conclusions: Primary shoulder arthroplasty in the form of HA, TSA, and RSA offers a reliable22 surgical option for JIA patients with respect to pain reduction and ROM improvements. Unique23 challenges still exist in this cohort, in particular younger patients with an elevated propensity for1

However, despite rotator cuff and glenoid concerns, TSA seems to be associated with better pain relief and patient reported outcomes with the most durability in the long term when compared to HA.Level of Evidence: Level III; Retrospective Cohort Comparison; Treatment StudyKeywords: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Hemiarthroplasty, anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty, reverse shoulder arthroplasty      Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in the pediatric population.14 JIA is a heterogeneous dis ase that is diagnosed when any form ofarthritis persists for 6 weeks or greater in a child of 16 years of age or younger and is of unknown etiology.14 TheJournal7differetsubtypes of JIA are classified according to the number ofjoints affected, serology and ext ticular manifestations. Accounting for all categories, JIA occurs in approximately 1 in 1,000 children and is diagnosed via history and physical examination, with joint stiffness being the most specific presenting symptom.2 Even with advancements in medical management, joint replacement surgery represents the standard treatment for patients with recalcitrant pain and decreasing function secondary to progressive inflammatory joint degeneration.      Patients with severe JIA and polyarticular involvement often undergo multiple joint replacement procedures, with the hip and knee being the most commonly and earliest affected joints. Consequently, most of the contemporary literature guiding orthopedic surgeons caring for patients with JIA is centered around the hip and knee.13 Pathology at the glenohumeral joint also2
JIA in SA47 causes substantial disability, but often occurs later in the disease course with 15% of patients48 being affected at 15 years.1149	Despite the documented success of total hip arthroplasty (THA)3 and total knee50 arthroplasty (TKA)12 in JIA, there remains paucity of information regarding the outcome of51 shoulder arthroplasty (SA) in this unique patient cohort. Madanipour et al11 recently performed a52 review of the available 4 studies reporting outcomes on 50 JIA patients receiving 58 shoulder53 replacements, with 33 hemiarthroplasties (HA) and 25 anatomic total shoulder arthroplasties54 (TSA).7,19 Overall, they demonstrated improvement in patient satisfacti  n and pain relief, but55 also highlighted the need for additional investigations with la ger numbers, longer term data, and56 less heterogeneity. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to review our outcomes following57	primary SA performed in patients with JIA. The p	s nt investigation reports on (i) clinical58 outcomes in terms of functional outcome measures and radiographic analysis, (ii) postoperative59 complications, and (iii) implant survivorship free from reoperation and revision.606162 MATERIALS AND METHODS63	Approval was first obtained from our Institutional Review Board (IRB) followed by data64 acquisition from a prospectively recorded Institutional Total Joint Registry. This registry65 prospectively captures data regarding complications, implant survival and patient-reported66 outcomes using a standardized data collection form as described previously. Data collection67 intervals include 1, 2, and 5 years postoperatively, and then every 5 years thereafter. For patients68 unable to return physically, they are requested to complete and return a validated outcomes69 questionnaire along with radiographs.17All adults who underwent a primary shoulder arthroplasty3
JIA in SA70 (n = 10,503) between January 1977 and December 2019 were identified. A subsequent review71 identified all patients with a diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (n = 79), as defined as72 only those patients formally diagnosed by team members of a multi-disciplinary rheumatologic73 clinic. Patients with a concomitant diagnosis of malignancy (n = 1), treatment with a metal74 backed glenoid component (n = 6), death secondary to unrelated events from index surgery (n =75 2), or less than 2 years of clinical follow-up were excluded (n = 3). The final cohort consisted of76 67 primary shoulder replacements (20 hemiarthroplasty (HA), 38 anatomic total shoulder77 arthroplasty (TSA), and 9 reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA)).78	Implant use for the entire cohort varied by surgeon. HA implants consisted of the Cofield79 2 shoulder prosthesis in 11 shoulders (Smith & N ph w, Memphis, TN, USA), Neer II shoulder80 prosthesis in 6 shoulders (3M Company, St Paul, MN, USA), and Bio-modular shoulder81 prosthesis in 3 shoulders (Biomet, Warsaw, IN, USA). TSA consisted of the Cofield 2 anatomic82 prosthesis in 16 shoulders (Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN, USA), Neer II anatomic prosthesis83 in 12 shoulders (3M Company, St Paul, MN, USA), Comprehensive anatomic prosthesis in 484 patients (Biomet, Warsaw, IN, USA), Aequalis anatomic shoulder prosthesis in 3 patients85 (Tornier/Viking, Montbonnot, France), ReUnion anatomic shoulder prosthesis in 2 patients86 (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA), and Bigliani/Flatow shoulder prosthesis in 1 patient (Zimmer,87 Warsaw, IN, USA). RSA implants consisted of the Comprehensive reverse prosthesis in 688 patients (Biomet, Warsaw, IN, USA), ReUnion reverse prosthesis in 2 patients (Stryker,89 Kalamazoo, MI, USA), and Aequalis reverse prosthesis in 1 patient (Tornier/Viking,90 Montbonnot, France).91	Operative intervention was completed by 1 of 8 upper extremity surgeons at a single92 institution. Indications for surgery was symptomatic glenohumeral arthritis refractory to4

The decision between implantation of various shoulder arthroplasty techniques (HA, TSA, RSA) was determined by the treating surgeon based on a combination of physical exam, rotator cuff status, and glenoid bone loss. RSA was not available for use until 2004, and as such all arthroplasties performed prior to that year were either HA (n = 17, 25.4%) or TSA (n = 19, 28.4%). After 2004, only 4 (6.0%) HA were performed but TSA use persisted with another 19 (28.4%) replacements. A standard deltopectoral approach was uniformly utilized. Glenoid bone grafting was performed in 2 shoulders (3%) with morselized cancellous graft in 1 TSA and structural graft in 1 TSA; of note, the structural graft was performed before RSA was available to the institution. Humeral bone grafting was performed in the remaining 4 shoulders (6%) with morselized cancellous autograft in 2 HA and 2 TSA. Additional procedures at the time of hemiarthroplasty were performed in 4 (6%) shoulders. These consisted of 3 rotator cuff repairs (2 TSA and 1 HA) and 1 lysis of adhesions in a HA.      A concurrent reviewJournalofistitutional Total Joint Registry Database as well as electronic medical record review was completed to obtain pre- and postoperative 10-point visualanalog pain scale scores, active range of motion measurements assessed in 3 planes (forward elevation, external rotation, and internal rotation), strength in 3 planes, and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES) score. Forward elevation and external rotation were measured in degrees, internal rotation was measured by the level reached by the thumb according to the scale by Flurin et al5. Additional clinical outcomes of interest included postoperative complications, and implant survivorship free from reoperations or revision surgery (revision being defined as subsequent removal and/or exchange of any components).5
JIA in SA116Pre- and postoperative imaging was independently reviewed by two surgeons (E.M.M117and B.S.S) in order to analyze the preoperative glenohumeral morphology and postoperative118implant changes. Preoperative severity of arthritis was determined by the Larsen et al119classification.9 When applicable, postoperative humeral head subluxation was classified120according to direction and graded mild, moderate, or severe according to the Torchia et al121classification.20 Postoperative glenoid erosion after HA was graded according to the method122proposed by Sperling et al.18 Postoperative radiolucencies    the glenoid and humeral componentproof123were graded according to Lazarus et al10 and Sanchez-Sotelo et al,15 respectively. For RSA,124scapular notching was graded according to the Nerot-Sirveaux g ading system.22125Data was statistically analyzed using JMP 14.1.0 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC,126 USA). Continuous variables were reported as m ans with ranges. Group means were compared127 utilizing student’s t-tests. Categorical variab es were analyzed using the ?2 test, or the Fisher128 exact test given low counts of some comp risons. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated129 to determine survivorship free f om  eoperation and revision. For all data points, statistical130 significance was considered to be achieved when the p value was less than 0.05.131132133 RESULTS134	A total of 67 primary shoulder SA (20 HA, 38 TSA, 9 RSA) met inclusion criteria. There135 were 58 females (86.6%) and 9 males (13.4%) with a mean age of 42.2 ± 15.6 and BMI of 26.0 ±136 6.5 at the time of surgery. Pertinent co-morbidities included chronic steroid use in 20 (29.9%)137 patients, treatment with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) in 14 (20.9%)138 patients, and prior surgery in 4 (6%) patients.

JIA in SAvs. TSA vs. RSA) included a younger age of surgery in HA (39 vs. 40.5 vs. 56.6; p = 0.001), shortest time between JIA diagnosis and surgery in HA (29.3 vs. 31.7 vs. 45.9; p = 0.02), and longest follow-up in HA (16.9 vs. 11.7 vs. 3.7; p =0.002). Additional, baseline demographic characteristics are detailed in Table 1.Functional Outcomes      At a mean follow-up of 12.2 years (range, 2 to 34 years), shoulder arthroplasty in patients with JIA demonstrated improvements in pain (8.0 to 1.1; P < 0.001), orward elevation (85.8? to 123.0?; P < 0.001), external rotation (23.8? to 42.5?; P < 0.01) and internal rotation (2.9 to 4.4; P = 0.03) (Table 2). At final follow-up the mean VAS was 1.1 ± 0.9 and the mean ASES score was 75.2 ± 9.4. When analyzed according to implant style, ostoperative pain was the lowest after TSA (0.8 ± 0.3), followed by HA (1.4 ± 0.4), and RSA (2.7 ± 0.6, p = 0.02). Further pairwisecomparisons demonstratedJournalsignificantdifference in favor of TSA over RSA p = 0.02). Postoperative ASES was the highest fter TSA (77.4 ± 3.5), followed by RSA (77.0 ± 1.5), andHA (70.8 ± 2.1, p = 0.04). Additional pairwise comparisons demonstrated a significant difference between TSA and HA (p = 0.04). With the numbers available, no implant differences were observed in forward elevation (P = 0.71), external rotation (P = 0.77), internal rotation (P = 0.71), forward elevation strength (P = 0.47), external rotation strength (P = 0.51), or internal rotation strength (P = 0.66) (Table 3).Radiographic Analysis      A total of 54 shoulders (80.6%) had preoperative imaging available. Glenohumeral joint changes were classified via the Larsen classification as grade III in 3, grade IV in 34, grade V in 16 shoulders. At the time of most recent follow-up, 58 of 67 shoulders (86.6%) had a complete postoperative Grashey and axillary film series allowing for review. Across all HA and TSA,7
JIA in SA162 humeral head subluxation was observed in 25 of 49 shoulders (51%), most commonly with a163 superior direction (n = 22). Radiolucent lines across all implant humeral stems were observed in164 12 of 58 shoulders (20.7%), most commonly at zone 1 (n = 9).165	Of the 16 HA available for review, glenoid erosion was present in 15 shoulders (93.7%):166 mild in 3, moderate in 6, and severe in 6. Humeral head subluxation was observed in 10 of 16167 shoulders (62.5%): 9 superior (mild = 4, moderate = 1, severe = 4) and 1 anterior. Humeral168 periprosthetic radiolucency was observed in 1 shoulder (6.3%) at zone 8. Of the 33 TSA169 available for review, 16 (48%) shoulders demonstrated radi lucencies about the glenoid170 component with a mean grade of 1.3. The Lazarus score was g ade 0 in 13 shoulders, grade 1 in171 4, grade 2 in 3, grade 4 in 3, and grade 5 in 4. Hum ral head subluxation was observed in 15 of172	33 shoulders (45.5%): 13 superior (mild = 4, mod	ate = 4, severe = 5) and 2 anterior. Humeral173 sided lucencies were observed in 10 of 33 (30.3%) shoulders: 7 in zone 1, 4 in zone 7, 1 in zone174 8. All 9 RSA were available for review; sc pular notching was noted in 2 of 9 shoulders (22.2%)175 at a severity of grade 1 for both shoulders. Humeral periprosthetic radiolucency was observed in176 1 of 9 (11%) shoulders at z  ne 1.177 Complications178	Perioperative complications were found in 14 (20.9%) of the shoulders, with rotator cuff179 failure (n=4; 5.9%) as the most common complication, followed by infection (n=3; 4.5%),180 aseptic component loosening (n=2; 3%), and nerve palsy / neuropathy (n=2; 3%). A subanalysis181 was performed comparing the various complication profiles by implant type (Table 4). There182 were 4 of 20 (20.0%) HA complications of which the most common was rotator cuff failure (n =183 2; 10%). There were 8 of 38 (21.1%) TSA complications of which the most common was rotator184 cuff failure (n = 2; 5.3%), infection (n = 2; 5.3%), and nerve palsy / neuropathy (n = 2; 5.3%).8
JIA in SA185 There were 2 of 9 (22.2%) RSA complications consisting of 1 (11.1%) aseptic humeral186 component loosening and 1 (11.1%) scapular spine fracture.187 Survivorship free from Reoperation, and Revision188	Reoperations were all in the form of revisions and occurred in 5 shoulders (7.5%), which189 consisted of a conversion to a HA for glenoid baseplate loosening in a TSA (1), conversion to a190 RSA for progressive glenoid arthrosis in a HA (1), revision RSA for humeral component191 loosening (1), conversion to RSA for instability in a TSA (1), and component removal and192 antibiotic spacer placement for deep infection in a TSA (1). Overall survival from reoperation /193 revision was found to be 97.0% at two years, 95.1% at five yea s, 93.0% at ten years, 89.4% at194 twenty years, and 79.5% at thirty years (Fig. 1). Wh n compared across implants the five-year195 survival rates were 89.7%, 100%, and 88.9% for HA, TSA, and RSA respectively (p = 0.22).196 After five years, only HA and TSA had avai able survivorship data with subsequent survival of197 89.7% and 96.5% at ten years, 89.7%   d 90.1% at twenty years, and 71.8% and 90.1% at 30198 years (Figure 1).199200 DISCUSSION201	JIA represents a chronic rheumatologic disease that occurs in the pediatric population and202 often continues to progress throughout life, leading to progressive polyarticular arthritis,203 substantial joint destruction, and disability.2 Pathology at the glenohumeral joint causes disability204 but often occurs later in the disease course, with 15% of patients being affected at 15 years.11205 Although shoulder JIA causes substantial reductions in quality of life and can severely interfere206 with activities of daily living, there continues to be limited outcome data in the contemporary207 literature to direct shoulder surgeons in the management of this population.

JIA in SAcohort of 67 primary SA in patients with juvenile inflammatory arthritis, excellent clinical outcomes were shown, with significant improvements in pain, forward elevation, external rotation, and internal rotation. Complications did occur in 20% of patients, with implant survivorship of 80% at 30 years.      This study represents one of the largest series to report exclusively on primary SA in patients with JIA. Of the few published studies available, there are reports of improved pain relief and functional scores following SA in JIA.7,8,11,19 In 2005, Thomas et al reported on nine HAs with systemic or polyarticular JIA observing excellent pain relief and improvements in the Constant-Murley Score (CMS) at a mean follow-up of six yea s. Functional improvements were also noted to deteriorate over time in their cohort which was attributed to the progression of the systemic disease.19 Later in 2018, Ibrahim et al po t d on 14 resurfacing HAs with a meanfollow-up of 10.4 years. They also reported excellent pain relief with 8 of 14 shoulders pain free, and the remainder reportingJournalonlymildpin and final follow-up. The CMS and Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) were utilized to measu e function. Six shoulders had a very good or excellentoutcome and 8 shoulders had good or fair outcome on CMS.7 Jolles et al reported on 13 patients with severe polyarticular JIA treated with SA (12 HA, 1 TSA) with 9-year follow-up. Pain significantly decreased following surgery by a mean of 6.7 using the VAS. They reported significant improvements in both forward elevation and external rotation but final SF-36 and DASH results were poor.8 The results of the present study are comparable to past studies that SA in JIA can lead to reliable decreases in pain and satisfactory functional improvements. One unique aspect of the current investigation is comparisons across various implants with TSA demonstrating the most significant improvement in final postoperative pain (0.8) and ASES score (77.4) as compared to HA and RSA.10
JIA in SA231	Patients with inflammatory arthritis and JIA present the treating surgeon with several232 unique challenges in executing the replacement. Immunosuppressing medications, rotator cuff233 disease, severe glenoid erosion and osteopenia are common characteristics in this patient234 population that can lead to elevated complication rates. In the Madanipour et al 11 review of the235 JIA literature to date, a 17% pooled complication rate was observed across all 4 studies236 reviewed. These complications included 3 intraoperative humeral fractures (2 HA and 1 TSA)237 that did not require additional fixation and 1 axillary nerve palsy (HA) that resolved over time in238 the Jolles et al cohort8. Deshmukh et al observed 1 TSA disl  cati  n in p st op day 1 that was239 treated with closed reduction and 1 TSA prosthetic joint infecti  n 10.4 years following the index240 procedure.4 Thomas et al observed 1 open excision of the acromioclavicular joint for ACJ241 arthritis and 1 persistent lateral forearm paraesth sias in HA.19  Finally, Ibrahim et al observed 2242 patients with subsequent subacromial impingement requiring arthroscopic subacromial243 decompression at 6 months after resurf cing HA. The present cohort observed a comparable but244 elevated complication rate of 21%, of which rotator cuff failure (6%) was the most common.245 This may partially be explained by the extended follow-up in this study (mean 12 years). With246 time, rotator cuff disease can be expected to progress, with rotator cuff tearing having been247 shown to increase over time following TSA.16,21 This highlights the importance of careful soft248 tissue balancing during TSA implantation in order to mitigate the likelihood of late rotator cuff249 failure and promote prosthesis longevity. Additionally, it is important to note that intra-operative250 fractures were not observed in this cohort despite the elevated concern from previous251 investigations.252	In comparison to rheumatoid arthritis, patients with JIA often experience prolonged253 periods of disease duration before arthroplasty, with joint replacement surgery commonly being11
JIA in SA254 completed at a relatively young age.13 In the limited JIA shoulder arthroplasty literature, mean255 age at time of arthroplasty has been reported at 32, 33.1, 36.4 and 60.3 years of age in the256 Thomas et al 19, Jolles et al 8,Ibrahim et al 7, and Deshmukh et al4 investigations respectively.257 Comparing with the rheumatoid literature, Barlow et al performed a similar investigation258 reporting on 303 consecutive shoulder arthroplasties (108 HA, 195 TSA) in rheumatoid arthritis259 with a minimum 5-year follow-up.1 In this cohort the average age was 55 years, approximately260 13 years older than the JIA cohort. Interestingly, they observed a 9% overall complication rate261 with 19 (9.7%) complications in the TSA group with and 9 (8.3%) c mplications in the HA262 group. In the TSA cohort, 10 (6.1%) nerve injuries, 4 (2.4%) int a perative fractures, 3 (1.8%)263 wound problems, 1 (0.6%) postoperative humeral shaft fracture, and 1 (0.6%) deltoid tear264 requiring intraoperative repair were observed. The HA group had 5 (5.5%) intraoperative265 fractures, 3 (3.3%) nerve injuries, and 1 (1.1%) wound problem.1 Recent systematic review on266	TSA in rheumatoid arthritis by Haleem et	l also observed an older aged cohort with a mean of267 68 years and a lower complication  ate of 9% compared to the present JIA study. 6 The present268 cohort received an arthr  plasty procedure at an average of 42 years, with a mean of 33 years269 from JIA diagnosis to surgery. Furthermore, this group of JIA patients experienced a 21%270 complication rate. These findings support the evidence that JIA often results in a younger age at271 the time of arthroplasty, and a higher complication rate especially when compared to rheumatoid272 arthritis.273	Despite the elevated complication rate in the present cohort, SA demonstrated excellent274 mid-term and good long-term survivorship in this patient population. Overall survival from275 reoperation / revision was found to be 95.1% at five years, 93.0% at ten years, 89.4% at twenty276 years, and 79.5% at thirty years. When compared across implants the five-year survival rates12

JIA in SAwere the highest with TSA at 100% followed by 89.7% for HA, and 88.9% for RSA. At final follow-up, TSA still had the best survivorship with 90.1% at 30 years, with HA now having the lowest survival with 71.8% at 34 years. Part of this discrepancy likely represents progression of inflammatory arthritis and development of painful glenoid erosion, which is alleviated by placement of a glenoid component. In further review of the current published JIA literature, mainly mid-term data is available. Interestingly, 3 of the 4 studies Thomas et al 19, Jolles et al8, and Ibrahim et al 7 demonstrated 100% survivorship free from revision in their cohorts with a mean follow-up of 6, 9, and 10 years, respectively. These excellent early results are similar to our cohort; however, the present investigation notes that as time c ntinues approximately 20% of patients will sustain some form of failure across all im lant ty es.The present investigation was not without limitations. Foremost, this was a retrospectiveanalysis of a prospectively collected registry data. Additionally, less than 1% of the shoulderreplacements performedJournalatistitutionduring the study period were performed on patientswith JIA, resulting in relatively small sample size. There was no formal control group to which the JIA cohort could be c mpared. Furthermore, the implant groups were not matched for the preoperative degree of glenohumeral arthritis, subluxation, or presence of associated rotator cuff injuries. This may limit some of the direct comparisons across the various prosthesis. Additionally, patients with JIA were treated by one of 8 staff surgeons at our institution who may have slight variations in surgical techniques. To assess this we presented the principles behind surgical decision making, the ultimate implants utilized, and all available intra-operative findings. Finally, the available dataset did not include any detailed perioperative information about the medical management of JIA, its comorbid conditions, and whether patients were adherent to any possible medical treatment recommendations. As such, there may be some13
JIA in SA300 underlying bias based on when patients were diagnosed and the available treatment options at301 that time.302303 CONCLUSION304	Primary shoulder arthroplasty in the form of HA, TSA, and RSA offers a reliable surgical305 option for JIA patients with respect to pain reduction and ROM improvements. Unique306 challenges still exist in this cohort, younger patients with an elevated propensity for glenoid bone307 erosion and a complication rate of 20.9%. As such, HA may n t be ideal in this patient308 population. However, despite rotator cuff and glenoid conce ns, TSA seems to be associated with309 better pain relief and patient reported outcomes with the most durability in the long term when310 compared to HA.311312 REFERENCES313 1.Barlow JD, Yuan BJ, Schleck CD, Harmsen WS, Cofield RH, Sperling JW.
